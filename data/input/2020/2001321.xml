<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Herbaria, collections of pressed and dried plant specimens, provide windows into the past.  They tell us what kinds of plants were present, where those plants were, and when the plants were there.  With this information we can track changes over time, such as the return of wildflowers and forest trees to previously farmed land, and the introduction and spread of invasive plant species.  Herbarium specimens are also records of past seasonal events such as when wildflowers bloomed, and when trees leafed out in the spring and dropped their leaves in fall.  The information stored in herbaria can help us understand past environmental changes, and also to predict and prepare for future change.  This project will allow six members of the Hudson Valley Environmental Monitoring and Management Alliance (EMMA) to digitize their collections.  Making the images and label information available online to anyone in the world will immeasurably increase the research and societal value of the EMMA herbaria.  The images and information will help the Alliance address urgent threats to ecosystem health in the Hudson Valley, including climate change, invasive species, habitat loss and fragmentation, and deer overabundance.  The EMMA herbarium information will also contribute to numerous other projects with scopes beyond the Hudson Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EMMA herbaria participating in this project are the Louis Calder Center of Fordham University, the Highstead Arboretum, the E.N. Huyck Preserve, the Mohonk Preserve, Pace University, and Vassar College.  Together, they will partner with the existing New England Vascular Plant Network (NEVP).   Approximately 22,250 specimens will be digitized, of which around 13,550 are from New York State.  This project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate students at Pace and Vassar, who will digitize specimens from those herbaria onsite.  A travelling team will carry out most of the digitization work at the other four herbaria.  This will increase the NEVP’s New York specimens by 27%.  Images and data will be made available through the Consortium of Northeastern Herbaria portal and through iDigBio.org.  Along with the herbarium data, site-specific weather and phenology data will be available to researchers through the Forest Ecosystems Monitoring Cooperative platform and the EMMA website.  Phenology data will also be available through the USA-National Phenology Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Herbaria, collections of plants that have been pressed, dried, mounted on archival paper and labeled, are the gold standard for documenting plant biodiversity. Figure 1 shows a collection of oriental bittersweet, an invasive vine, made at the Preserve at Vassar College.      Herbaria can tell us where plants have been, what other plants they were found with, when they flowered and produced fruit, when they leafed out and when their leaves dropped, and many other things about plants that have been collected up until now. For a long time, this kind of information was important mostly for professional botanists, and they were also the only people who had relatively easy access to herbaria. That was because in order to study herbarium specimens, you had to view them directly. You had to either go to the herbaria yourself, or you had to ask to borrow specimens, wait for them to be shipped to you, and then return them once youd studied them. All of this was time consuming and expensive.      But recently this situation has changed dramatically. First, biodiversity scientists of all sorts, from conservationists to invasive species ecologists to climate scientists, have realized that herbaria are treasure troves of information on the spread of invasive species and changes in the geographical distributions and abundances of species, and changes in flowering and fruiting times. Data from herbarium specimens can be used to reconstruct the spread of invasive species, to understand responses to past climate change, to model responses to future change, and to manage natural areas. Second, digital technologies have made access to much of the information in herbarium specimens available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection. These changes have increased awareness of the value of herbaria and spurred global efforts to digitize them.      Our project digitized six small herbaria located in the Hudson Valley of southeastern New York State: The Louis Calder Center of Fordham University, the Highstead Arboretum, the Edmund H. Huyck Preserve, the Mohonk Preserve, Pace University, and Vassar College. Each of the herbaria includes specimens from a natural area that is part of the Environmental Monitoring and Management Alliance (EMMA). Figure 2 shows the locations of these six herbaria.      We had two major goals. The first was to augment an ongoing effort by the New England Vascular Plants Network to digitize herbarium collections from the New England region. New England which is one of the most thoroughly botanized regions in the world, and hence a prime region for digitization of herbaria.. But plants do not recognize state boundaries, and New York State shares over 90% of its plant species with New England. We enhanced the New England Vascular Plants Network by digitizing approximately 13,500 specimens from New York State, thus increasing the NEVPNs digitized New York specimens by 27%. Our second goal was to enhance EMMAs ability to coordinate ecological monitoring and natural areas management throughout New Yorks Hudson Valley. We accomplished that by digitizing 7,200 specimens that are site-specific to EMMA natural areas.      Education of undergraduate students was integral to this project. Twentythree Vassar College students completed a one-semester Intensively Mentored Experience in Plant Biodiversity in which they digitized specimens, two students participated as Undergraduate Research Summer Institute Fellows, and eight students contributed to the project through work-study. Figure 3 shows 2022 Vassar graduates Alison Carranza and Garrett Goodrich working with Vassar Professor Emeritus Mark Schlessman.      Through a project website and stories put out by several of the EMMA institutions, this project also increased awareness of and appreciation for herbaria in New Yorks Hudson Valley.
