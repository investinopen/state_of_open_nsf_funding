<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Climate change is one of the most pressing societal issues of our time, with implications for human health and welfare, the economy, and national security. Improved projections of future climate rely on more detailed understanding of the mechanisms driving Earth’s climate system, which can often be illuminated from the perspective of geological records of past climates. The research funded by this award will examine the largest global warming event in the recent geological past: the transition from the last ice age to the present interglacial world. First, a climate record will be produced by documenting the age and location of landforms left by rapidly retreating glaciers at the end of the last ice age. These records will then be used, along with computer models, to test hypotheses about different components of the climate system that are thought to play important roles in rapid warming of Earth. Such information will improve understanding of how Earth’s climate system operates and inform models used for climate prediction. This detailed understanding of Earth's climate system may help policy makers to articulate climate policies that will provide multiple societal benefits. The researchers will also educate young scientists in STEM fields, thereby increasing the STEM workforce, which is in the national interest. This award will also will support the education of a science journalism student, who will be trained to communicate the science results to the public, providing long-term benefits of public awareness and understanding of global change science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite significant progress, the origin of ice-age terminations remains unresolved. At the core of this issue is the precise inter- and intra-hemispheric timing of the end of the ice age, because such information yields clues as to the mechanisms that underlie the termination. The research team will test the hypothesis that the temperature rise of the last termination in southern latitudes was earlier and faster than previously recognized, so fast that it may require a major overhaul of existing hypotheses. The research project will use detailed radiocarbon and exposure dating of glacial landforms, along with glaciological modeling, to document the timing and magnitude of the termination of the Cordillera Darwin icefield, in southernmost South America. These data will be integrated with existing paleoclimate records at lower latitudes with the GFDL Earth System Model 2M to assess the feasibility of various forcing factors for the termination, such as an ocean bipolar seesaw, shifting of the southern hemisphere westerlies, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. This work will strengthen collaborations between US and Chilean institutions and afford mentoring and education opportunities for students. The research team will embed a science journalism graduate student in the field party, who will produce articles in a variety of media formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Vanishing glaciers are an iconic physical representation and reminder of these changes. Poleward intensification of the austral westerly wind system, the most powerful on Earth, toward the Antarctic continent has accelerated upwelling of relatively warm circumpolar deep water near Antarctic grounding lines, with implications for potential destabilization of fringing ice shelves and ice streams. Likewise, this poleward intensification of the austral westerlies has facilitated incursions of hot, humid tropical air masses (&lsquo;atmospheric rivers&rsquo;) into Southern Hemisphere (SH) middle and high latitudes, including over the Antarctic ice sheets. These observations indicate a profound role for the global wind systems in general, and the austral westerlies in particular, in accelerating the impacts of a warming world. <br /><br />Mountain glaciers are highly sensitive physical recorders of changes in the circulation and energy content of the atmosphere. <strong>Glacier ice integrates and responds very rapidly to atmospheric processes</strong>, thereby responding to climate on timescales of years to decades and integrate atmospheric conditions across large areas and elevation gradients within the troposphere. Additionally, the relationship between ice and climate is purely physical. Unlike biological proxies, glaciers have no adaptation strategy. Glacial landforms provide quantitative metrics for reconstructing past ice area, volume, and hence associated atmospheric conditions. For these reasons, glacier-derived climate reconstructions afford ideal real-world metrics for evaluating Earth System Model results, which are particularly adept at resolving vertical thermal gradients being monitored by mountain glaciers.<br /><br />The precise dating of the advances and retreat of glaciers around the globe has proven to be one of the best, if not the best, indicators of <strong>transient global climate change</strong>. This work, in conjunction with other studies, is providing further evidence of the Zealandia Switch Hypothesis (Denton et al. 2021) which states that <strong>the transition out of the last glacial period was big, fast and global </strong>&ndash; glaciers from <em><strong>around the world</strong></em> all indicate <em><strong>large temperature changes</strong></em> over the <em><strong>same short interval</strong></em> (centuries, not millennia). The powerful influence of the austral westerlies on temperatures and glacial snowlines in the southernmost Southern Andes of Patagonia are further support for our interpretation of moraine chronologies, and for developing future projections of climate change. <br /><br />Most <em><strong>other paleoclimate indicators are representative of equilibrium climate change</strong></em>, with a temporal resolution of more than several thousand years. The next 200-1000 years, however, will be a <strong>period of transient climate change</strong>. The precise dating of glacial changes, of the sort carried out in this proposal, will allow us to finally have <strong>observationally-based metrics of transient change</strong>. Metrics like these are critical to evaluating the performance and fidelity of earth system models. As such, these observations will have a strong impact on the fields of climate dynamics, earth system modeling and prediction, by r<strong>educing the uncertainty associated with past simulations</strong> and, therefore (hopefully), r<strong>educing the uncertainty associated with future projections</strong>.
