<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The detections of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes in 2015 launched the field of gravitational wave astronomy. The NSF-funded “A+” upgrade to Advanced LIGO is designed to achieve an order of magnitude increase in detection rate for black hole coalescences, and enable detection of fainter objects like binary neutron stars, greatly increasing their value for multi-messenger astronomy. The A+ upgrade and all 3rd generation detector designs depend on the development of mirrors with low coating thermal noise. The coating thermal noise is reduced, primarily, by lowering the mechanical (elastic) loss of the mirror materials. The core research focus of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) Center for Coatings Research (CCR) is the development of mirror coatings with low mechanical and optical losses for use in A+ and 3rd generation detectors. The research mission of the CCR includes: understanding and reducing mechanical loss in amorphous metal-oxides, the most widely-used materials in mirror coatings; and developing and testing crystalline (AlGaAs) coatings, which have demonstrated low losses for small mirrors. On a longer time-scale, the CCR is developing mirrors compatible with the proposed 3G detectors’ cryogenic operation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The residual noise visible in the time-domain gravitational waveforms of black hole mergers first recorded by Advanced LIGO is mostly due to quantum noise of the light and thermal noise due to the mirror coatings. Since that first discovery much progress has been made in reducing quantum noise and the coupling from seismic, scatter and jitter noise, leaving coating thermal noise as the dominant barrier limiting gravitational-wave astronomy in the most sensitive observation band. Reducing this noise source for future generations of detectors requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses, and forms the main goal of the CCR. The CCR combines groups working on computational modeling, coating deposition, and characterization of atomic structure and macroscopic material properties. These components are often performed by four diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these communities focused on a unified research goal. In its first two years of operation, research in the CCR has identified different structural motifs associated with room-temperature vs cryogenic mechanical losses, which led to synthesis of germania (GeO2) films giving rise to the lowest-loss amorphous oxide film other than silica. Going forward, this structural guide will serve as a paradigm informing the development of high-refractive index amorphous coatings with lower elastic loss. In addition, thermo-optically-optimized AlGaAs crystalline coatings have demonstrated a coating thermal noise well below the requirements for A+, and the CCR has generated a development schedule to scale up these coatings to LIGO mirror sizes and will continue investigations into these materials. Other research paths include: exploring deposition techniques to produce “ultrastable glasses” using amorphous metal-oxides; and stabilizing amorphous coatings against crystallization in order to allow elastic loss reduction via high temperature annealing either with nano-layering or with different doping materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The LIGO Scientific Collaboration Center for Coatings Research (CCR) is a collaborative project spanning eight institutions and co-funded by the NSF and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Over the course of this three-year award the CCR made significant strides in addressing thermal noise in interferometer mirrors, a critical barrier in enhancing the sensitivity of LIGO's future iterations. Our research has included: the development of Ti:GeO2 coatings that have the potential to meet the thermal noise requirements for Advanced LIGO +, the development of other amorphous coatings such as hydrogenated amorphous Silicon that show promise for implementation in future detectors, expanding our understanding of the atomic-level mechanisms responsible for mechanical loss which is directly related to thermal noise, and progressing the development of AlGaAs crystalline coatings.      California State University Los Angeles: major results over the last three years.   The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from continuing the close integration of our research groups and working together with the LIGO-labs at Caltech and MIT, and wider LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. The broader impact of our research lies in enabling upgrades to LIGO that have lower coating thermal noise that advances our understanding of the universe through new discoveries in gravitational wave astronomy, as well as contributing valuable insights into fundamental materials physics and precision optics.   The focus of the team at California State University Los Angeles (CSULA) in this three-year project was initially that of demonstrating the effectiveness of nano-layering in impeding crystallization in interferometer LIGO mirrors by performing X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD) of e-beam deposited nano-layered amorphous mirror coatings (generated at the Sannio coater) recorded in between annealing cycles.   It is well known that post deposition thermal annealing of amorphous coatings improves optical properties of dielectric mirrors. However, excessive temperatures cause crystallization, resulting in a degradation of mechanical and optical properties. Therefore, annealing is limited to temperatures below the crystallization threshold. The threshold is determined by XRD measurement which requires a significant amount of crystallized material for detection, yet it has been shown that a population of light scattering nanocrystals (crystallites)may exist in otherwise amorphous coatings below the threshold temperature.   During the first year's activity, while performing XRD analysis, we observed an unexpected crystal size limit in some conditions and focused on the study of a model for the determination of the maximum crystal size, suggesting a model refinement in the energy equation driving crystal growth. This new objective was added because of unexpected observations but led to the major result of the project.   In fact, further XRD investigations performed at CSULA on three different materials (titania, zirconia and tantala deposited metal oxide samples) showed crystallites that grow during annealing within amorphous oxide coatings to a limited and predictable size.   These sizes, much smaller than the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra interferometer wavelength, are predicted by the higher density of the crystallized material with respect to the surrounding amorphous medium and the published materials' Youngs modulus values by introducing a fourth power term to the expression for the Gibbs free energy of a crystallite. These crystallites may be the point-like, extremely weak scatterers revealed in the LIGO test masses when imaged off-axis, and this finding may be critical to explain the observed wide-angle scattering of light in the mirrors, and perhaps to thermal noise as the predicted interfacial stress at the crystal amorphous interface may also relate to the two-level systems that generates mechanical dissipation.   The attached figure shows the predicted maximum crystallite size from the developed model for the titania (TiO2), zirconia (ZrO2) and tantala (Ta2O5)deposited metal oxide samples against the values for the average maximum crystallite sizes obtained from measurements, demonstrating a reasonable match between model and measurements.   If the crystallites are confirmed to be the main source of wide-angle scattering, crystallite suppression could also result in thermal noise reduction, which would be an important result in the design of LIGO-Virgo-Kagra interferometer mirrors.
