<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[General audience abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultrashort laser pulses have properties that suggest they might be used to directly influence chemical reactions:  the force exerted by the laser field can be comparable to the electric force that holds a molecule together, and the pulse can be turned on and off before the molecule will move significantly.  Thus, the precise application of a customized laser pulse to an individual molecule might enable the modification of the molecule in a targeted, desired manner.  Stated another way, the laser can be thought of as a new type of reagent that drives a chemical reaction.  The development of these laser-based reagents could one day allow chemical synthesis of novel materials and medicines that contribute to the public well-being.  Progress toward this long-standing goal has been made, but molecules are complex and dynamic, making it difficult to determine the specific laser characteristics to drive a particular process.  This work probes the fundamentals of the interactions between strong laser fields and molecules to improve the understanding needed to design appropriate laser pulses.   Doing this work with undergraduate students provides motivation for further scientific education and therefore helps develop a highly-skilled workforce.  Undergraduate students from Augustana University carry out this work using the laser facilities of the J.R. Macdonald Laboratory at Kansas State University in collaboration with the researchers there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical audience abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work probes bond rearrangement in polyatomic molecules using shaped laser pulses to initiate molecular dynamics and sophisticated detection schemes to measure the reaction products. Bond rearrangement, which occurs in forms such as scrambling, hydrogen migration, and roaming, encompasses several of the steps in any chemical reaction. By applying rapid three-dimensional image-based feedback to the closed-loop control of bond rearrangement, the investigators can determine how well these essential steps in a chemical reaction can be controlled by applying a suitable laser field. In addition, the researchers will increase the data acquisition rate of coincidence-time-of-flight feedback for closed-loop control.  In either technique, the highly specific feedback guides the closed-loop search to a well-defined goal. Separating the ionization step from the manipulation of the nuclear wave packet during the rearrangement process using multiple laser pulses makes the examination of the control mechanism more direct.  By improving the understanding of how the application of a strong, non-perturbative laser field can affect processes via manipulation of the relative phases of the frequency components in the broad bandwidth pulse, the project examines a widely applicable method of coherent control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Employing lasers to directly manipulate molecules has been a goal of scientists for many years, and for good reasons. Using a laser to break or enhance the formation of a specific molecular bond at just the right time could introduce a fundamentally new method of creating novel materials, moving beyond the tools we currently use for chemical synthesis. These tools are mostly familiar to anyone that cooks  you can change the ingredients, heat or cool, mix, separate, or pressurize in some combination or sequence. There are lots of possibilities, and humans are clever at finding ways to use these tools and highly skilled at implementing these methods, but sending a laser in to directly convert a molecule into a different form would be new.    A laser is an ideal tool for such a purpose because it can provide light with a specific energy and duration, and the timing between pulses can be precisely controlled. But it remains a challenging problem because it turns out that even small molecules behave in complicated ways. It is hard, for example, to put energy into a single atom within the molecule and expect it stay there. Instead, the energy very quickly moves elsewhere. In addition, the energy can also change form. A fundamental question in this field is called electronic-nuclear coupling. In other words, if you put energy into a molecules electrons, how does that energy get translated so it starts moving the much more massive atomic nuclei in the molecule, thereby altering the structure of the molecule? If we can understand this process in more detail, we will have a better chance of controlling the molecules and cooking with lasers.   In this work, we explored how hydrogen atoms move within molecules after the electrons in the molecule are excited. We did this in formic acid (HCOOH) which has two hydrogen atoms, one on each end, and ethanol (CH3CH2OH) which has three hydrogen atoms on one end, two in the middle, and one on the other end. One of our major advances was discovering a method that could distinguish hydrogen atoms from each of the three sites in ethanol. Previously, this was difficult because there are only two isotopes of hydrogen that can be used for this purpose. The results indicated that all of the hydrogen atoms in ethanol can migrate extensively. This knowledge will help us to develop future experiments that try to control these migrations.   A primary broader impact of our work is the development of highly trained undergraduate students that often continue on in science, technology, engineering or mathematical (STEM) fields. In this award period, five undergraduate students and one high-school student were supported. The two students that have graduated have all gone on to graduate school in physics. The high-school student is now a third-year physics major at MIT. The other three students are still at Augustana University and currently plan to continue their STEM education after graduation or enter the workforce in a STEM area.   Our experimental work is conducted at Kansas State Universitys J.R. Macdonald Laboratory in collaboration with researchers there.
