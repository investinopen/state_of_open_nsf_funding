<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. The past two decades have witnessed compounding problems in observational cosmology that simply don’t go away: the accelerated expansion of the Universe, tension between the local and early Universe epoch measurements of the Hubble constant, and non-detection of dark matter are prime examples of crises in physics.  A multitude of effort is being made to better understand these problems as one does not know where the problem might be.  Modified gravity theories are seen as one possible solution. Likewise, conceptual problems in general relativity need to be examined observationally from a variety of different approaches to be successful. This award will test general relativity in ways complementary to other tests (e.g. the black hole no-hair test) and probe the strong-field regime of gravity, making the full use of the signal. These tests will either detect violation of general relativity or constrain certain modified theories of gravity that have been invoked to explain the aforementioned cosmological problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Relativity has been a tremendously successful theory in explaining current astronomical observations and laboratory experiments. Nevertheless, there is a general consensus that the theory is at best incomplete, representing an approximation to a more complete theory that cures some or all of its problems. The work supported by this grant is takes a two-pronged approach to explore general relativistic violations: 1. Measure the multipolar structure of the observed radiation to test for self-consistency of general relativity. 2. An incoherent, time-frequency test that checks for consistency of the observed signal-power in different multipoles with the predictions of general relativity. The tests will improve upon the current approach in two significant ways. Firstly, for binaries with large mass asymmetry (m1/m2&gt;2) and orbital inclinations more than 30 degrees one can expect appreciable signal power in higher order multipoles. Secondly, by making use of the full inspiral-merger-ringdown signal in the analysis increases the signal-to-noise ratio in higher modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The groundbreaking discovery of gravitational waves by the American Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2015 marked a pivotal moment in scientific history, opening new vistas for understanding the Universe. Subsequent detections by LIGO and the European Virgo have unveiled insights into coalescing binaries of neutron stars and black holes, prompting plans for even more sensitive detectors like the US Cosmic Explorer (CE) and European Einstein Telescope (ET), which will observe these systems from epochs before the first stars began to appear in the Universe.     General Relativity has been a highly successful physical theory of gravity and spacetime, predicting and explaining new phenomena such as the gravitational bending and redshift of light, precession of gyroscopes, and production and propagation of gravitational waves. However, the theory has been plagued by drawbacks such as the black hole singularity and the information paradox.

Stellar mass black holes and neutron stars are the best testbeds of the theory as, among all astrophysical objects we know, they produce the greatest spacetime curvature in their vicinity. Gravitational waves from merging neutron stars and black holes should, therefore, have the best potential to reveal failure of general relativity.     Tests of general relativity based on events discovered during the first three observing runs have not revealed any data that is inconsistent with the theory. However, these tests were somewhat restrictive in that they did not consider the full parameter space of possible deviations but instead focussed one parameter at a time.

In essence, this comprehensive exploration of gravitational-wave physics carried out in our studies not only reflects on current data sets but also outlines the exciting prospects and challenges that lie ahead, promising to deepen our understanding of the cosmos with next generation observatories like the Cosmic Explorer.
