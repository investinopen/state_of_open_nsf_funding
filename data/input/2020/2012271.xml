<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Principled simulations of many real-world problems (such as fluid flow, geophysical phenomena, and quantum mechanics) require an evolution in time with high accuracy, yet in a structurally simple and robust fashion. This project develops novel time integration methods for complex multi-physics problems, while not incurring fundamental problems that reduce the accuracy or stability of many existing methods. The developed methods are founded in new mathematical theories, and are used to devise more accurate and robust simulations of shallow water flows with dispersive effects, which are important in the understanding of tsunamis, storm surge, and coastal flooding.  This project will support one graduate student for two years at NJIT and one graduate student per year at the second institution, Temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops methods for the time integration of differential equations that are implemented as sequences of generalized Euler steps, including: multistage diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) and multistep implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods. Such methods are significant as they reduce the implementation burden on a practitioner to the solution of a fully- or semi-implicit Euler step for their initial-boundary-value problem. The key research contributions are: (A) a full algebraic theory of weak stage order, and its use to design optimized high-order DIRK methods devoid of order reduction; (B) a stability theory for IMEX methods applied to differential algebraic equations, and the co-design of IMEX splittings and scheme coefficients to overcome stability limitations prevalent in existing methods. Applications include new efficient time-stepping for the dispersive shallow water equations and related differential algebraic equations. The collaborative mentoring of graduate students at two campuses is an important component of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  High order of convergence is a highly desirable property of numerical methods for time-dependent differential equations. At the same time, many practically relevant problems possess structures that render robust, efficient, high-order convergent time stepping challenging. This project has addressed several of these challenges, both via establishing fundamental theoretical foundations and by providing concrete new methods, in the following ways.  Intellectual merit 1: A rigorous algebraic theory of weak stage order was developed, including formal proofs under which conditions, and by what mechanisms, weak stage order overcomes order reduction. Order reduction occurs in many multistage time stepping methods for still problems, both in dynamical systems and in many partial differential equations. The developed theory augments the classical Runge-Kutta order conditions by additional constraints that the methods's coefficients need to satisfy.  Intellectual merit 2: Leveraging the developed weak stage order theory, this project established systematic methodologies to construct new high-order Runge-Kutta schemes that also satisfy the weak stage order conditions (and thus mitigate order reduction) and are L-stable (and thus are, for any stable problem, guaranteed to be devoid of spurious instabilities). Based on these methodologies, novel diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods with optimal approximation errors were found that are convergent up to order 5 for wide classes of relevant problems.  Intellectual merit 3: A theory of time stepping methods for Langevin equations was developed that highlighted fundamental challenges in achieving correct statistics via Stormer-Verlet thermostats, a widely used tool in computational molecular dynamics. This theory was then leveraged to establish novel perspectives on time stepping methods as splitting methods, and allowed the proposal of new classes and implementations of methods that achieve an optimal recovery of relevant statistical quantities.  Broader Impacts: This project was a close collaboration between Temple University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and as such it provided unique training opportunities for one PhD student at Temple, who was co-mentored by the project PI at NJIT, and one (female) PhD student at NJIT, who was co-mentored by the project PI at Temple. Several research thrusts also involved active collaborations with KAUST, UC Davis, Los Alamos, and MIT. A key aspect of this research is that the newly developed methods (made publicly available) are very easy to implement into existing codes, and the active collaborations with researchers at national labs have provided first pathways for the adoption of the new methods into some of their software stack.
