<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Naturally occurring porous and granular materials, such as soil, sand, and clay, play a pivotal role in regulating the Earth's water resources by filtering contaminants and, over long timescales, supplying fresh water. Understanding of this contamination and filtration cycle relies on the phenomenon of transport and dispersion in porous media, with the added complexity that continually flowing groundwater can, over time, alter the details of the porous medium itself such as the size, shape, and position of individual sand grains. These effects are most noticeable during rapid events such as the gravitational collapse of a sinkhole, but can also occur due to the accumulation of slower processes, such as mechanical or chemical erosion. This project will leverage advanced computational methods to study in detail the interplay between fast and slow processes by which groundwater flow alters porous medium properties. By gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying physical processes, the project offers the societal benefit of better management of water resources in the face external factors, such as contamination or sinkhole formation. For example, the understanding developed herein may enable identification of specific regions most susceptible to contamination or to collapse. Graduate students will be involved and receive mentoring and interdisciplinary training in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to analyze a set of complex, dynamical problems that arise in geophysical porous-media applications by using a host of newly developed computational tools and reduced mathematical models. The particular problems of interest include: (1) the erosion of microscopic constituents of porous media leading to anisotropic macroscopic properties; (2) the modified transport of tracers through the medium, including anomalous dispersion; and (3) the occurrence of catastrophic events, such as sink hole collapse, resulting from interaction between groundwater seepage, erosion, and buoyancy forces. The project will address several computational challenges and opportunities. First the range of scales is vast: spatial scales range from microscopic granular constituents to large geological aquifers; timescales range from that of a sudden sinkhole collapse to years required mechanical and chemical erosion. The systems are inherently multicomponent, with coupling between the fluid and solid phases. Although the governing PDEs are linear, the presence of moving boundaries introduces nonlinear feedback between geometry and flow. One challenge in computational fluid dynamics is to obtain high-fidelity simulations of dense suspensions of dynamic bodies. Using integral equation methods in conjunction with accurate quadrature, fast summation methods, contact algorithms, and high-order time stepping, this project will use fast numerical methods to accurately simulate dense suspensions of anisotropic eroding, dissolving, and sedimenting bodies. Mixed-scale, deep neural networks will be used to learn from the data generated by high-fidelity numerical simulations to parameterize coarse-grained models based on the multiphase framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The focus of this project is dynamic changes in granular and porous media, for example, the soil medium that supports groundwater flow. Overtime, the characteristics of the medium itself can evolve due to slow erosive effects of the permeating flow, transport of individual grains,and dispersion of solvents or reactants. Media are subject to more catastrophic changes as well, such as the sudden collapse associated with sink holes. The PIs developed a novel computational framework to describe these dynamics effects, including the feedback between evolving media and the intervening flow. The foundation of this framework is a highly efficient algorithm (called a boundary integral method) to compute the intervening flow field for a given configuration of particles that comprise the medium.

When diffusion occurs slowly, traditional numerical methods necessitate large amounts of computational effort to study the late-time behaviors. To address this, we developed a novel method that simulates diffusion at user-specified times without the need for knowledge of the diffused concentration at earlier times.

The theoretical predications of this model are in close agreement with laboratory experiments that create these structures by allowing solidified sugar to dissolve in water. In particular, measurements of how the apex sharpens over time agree closely with what the model predicts, thus supporting the idea that the natural structures were formed have a similar physical origin.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 11/29/2023<br> Modified by: Bryan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Quaife</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2012560/2012560_10690231_1701312361054_Velocity_80_4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2012560/2012560_10690231_1701312361054_Velocity_80_4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Velocity_80particles"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2012560/2012560_10690231_1701312361054_Velocity_80_4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Velocity_80particles"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The erosion of a porous medium initiated with 80 circular bodies.
