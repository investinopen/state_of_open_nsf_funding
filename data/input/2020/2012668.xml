<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award will provide support to the Duke Lemur Center (DLC), a unique living stock collection of the world's most endangered and biologically diverse primates - the lemurs of Madagascar. Lemurs are exclusive to the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar, and due to their critically-endangered status, are not a renewable resource. Serving as a living laboratory for advancing interdisciplinary research, scholarship, and conservation, the DLC is the only place in the world where lemurs are readily available for comparative study together with associated biological samples, decades of medical records, life history data, and fossil relatives of living taxa. The diversity of the colony enables an expansive scope of science to be conducted and communicated, covering disciplines ranging from behavioral ecology, cognition, sensory communication, biomechanics, anatomy, life-history strategy, metagenomics, phylogenomics, population genetics, metabolomics, and more. In addition, the DLC is an exceptional training ground for students across academic levels. Over its 54-year history, thousands of students ranging from K-12 through postgraduate levels have been engaged in and inspired by their experiences at the DLC. The veterinary department supports educational activities via work-study opportunities and veterinary student training, including an internship for Malagasy veterinarians.  Critically, the DLC is committed to conservation activities via both ex situ captive management and extensive community-based Madagascar programs. Hundreds of thousands of visitors from the general public have been exposed to the concepts of biodiversity discovery and conservation, as well as the power of biological research via their exposure to the DLC's staff, students, and collections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching aim of this award is to strategically enhance the value of the DLC’s living collection through eight short-term goals that will provide significant opportunities to generate additional research and build multi-disciplinary collaborations, increase the digital availability of data from living stocks, biological tissues, and natural history collections, and increase education outreach and veterinary training activities.  The first five goals directly facilitate and enhance ongoing and planned research to identify species (in particular genomic and paleontological data), understand organismal systems (in particular biomechanics, endocrinology, physiology, microbial ecology, behavior, and metabolics – including torpor), and more broadly, to understand evolutionary patterns and the links across biological scales between genotypes and phenotypes. The remaining goals facilitate outreach and education activities so that the significance of the research will be communicated to a broad audience. Colony support is central to meeting these goals for advancing key programs in biological research, education, and conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since its inception in 1966, the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) has advanced scholarship and conservation of lemurs &ndash; Earth&rsquo;s most threatened group of mammals. The DLC provides opportunities for scientists, conservationists, educators, and students to work &ndash; independently and together &ndash; to understand and protect these extraordinary animals. The DLC has the largest living collection of endangered primates in the world, and impacts research, conservation, and education in the United States and internationally. The study of lemurs informs broader questions about the genetic and biological underpinnings of the human condition, the diversity of life on earth, and the relevance of biodiversity conservation for the future of humans.</p> <p>The main activities over the past three years focused on caring for the lemur colony and making it available to the scientific community for research. Since lemurs are likely susceptible to Covid-19, the DLC enacted strict safety protocols to minimize risk of transmission. In March 2020, the DLC shut down on-site tours, educational programs, and research. On-site research resumed in July 2020, but tour operations did not resume until spring 2023. Daily operations were significantly affected by the pandemic and continue to be in various states of recovery. The same is true of the project&rsquo;s short-term goals.</p> <p>Although travel to Madagascar was not possible until late 2021, one of the DLC&rsquo;s greatest priorities over the past three years continues to be increased collaboration with colleagues in Madagascar. The DLC created several funding opportunities for Malagasy students and researchers, including a scholarship offered to five Malagasy students to help them complete their research through to publication and a Field Improvement Grant offered to five early-career Malagasy researchers conducting fieldwork on lemur ecology, behavior, or conservation in Madagascar. &nbsp;In 2023 the DLC Field Station in Anjajavy, Madagascar was constructed. The field station provides the infrastructure to advance our non-invasive research activities and serves as a training ground and study site for Malagasy and U.S. students and researchers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The long-running <em>in-situ</em> conservation program in the SAVA region continued with less interruption, as several of this program&rsquo;s initiatives are managed by Malagasy staff employed by the DLC. In June 2023, the DLC resumed the technician exchange program, with a senior DLC husbandry technician working in Madagascar as a Technical Advisor to Zoo Ivoloina. The 10-week Malagasy veterinary internship program provides on-site, advanced training to Malagasy veterinarians and resumes in spring 2024.</p> <p>Post-pandemic, the DLC experienced record-breaking research activity, and in 2023, we hired an additional full-time Research Technician. Over the past three years, 107 principal investigators from 51 academic institutions carried out 137 research projects, including 31 undergraduate and 32 graduate student PIs. The number of biological disciplines impacted continues to increase and includes genomics, virology, cognition, biomechanics, physiology, behavior and ecology. The DLC serves as a model institution for the collection of maximum data with minimal disturbance of vertebrate subjects by developing sophisticated methods for non-invasive data collection. These methods also contribute to the DLC's system for maintaining animals that are in optimum health, thereby assuring that researchers are gathering data of the highest possible quality.</p> <p>The irreplaceable BioBank of preserved biological samples is a resource to the scientific community. Samples are collected opportunistically (e.g., feces), during routine veterinary procedures, and at necropsy and are available to researchers. The project goals to grow and enhance security of the BioBank resulted in the addition of 2361 blood samples and 1893 tissue samples from 12 species.&nbsp; Three new ultracold (-80C) freezers were donated to replace the oldest freezers in our collection.</p> <p>There are student research and/or training opportunities across all departments as independent researchers, volunteers, interns, and research assistants. The summer internship program resumed in 2022, after a two-year hiatus due to COVID. This 10-week program is project-driven, with interns from all departments (Research, Animal Welfare, Husbandry, Fossils, and Communications) required to complete an independent research project. Twenty students from 14 universities across the U.S. were selected from a highly competitive applicant pool. The DLC offered (for the first time) 1-2 paid positions per department based on financial need.</p> <p>Public outreach includes the general public, K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate students. A project goal was to innovate in public outreach, emphasizing research communication.&nbsp; We engaged with the public through social media and expanded online learning opportunities, including virtual tours and private Zoom chats with lemur experts. The Educator Portal on the DLC website opens in early 2024 and offers free resources for educators including videos, curriculum supplements, and printable media files. A new, year-long program sends DLC educators into a local middle school where they have taught over 300 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;grade students using hands-on and student-led research activities. We collaborated with the MiniPCR company to make available the Lemur Conservation Genetics lab (including genetics and chloroplast sequencing kits) to science teachers across the country.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 01/02/2024<br> Modified by: Erin&nbsp;Ehmke</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223627142___em_7181_6972_4DH1858ED--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223627142___em_7181_6972_4DH1858ED--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mongoose Lemur"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223627142___em_7181_6972_4DH1858ED--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mongoose Lemur"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Adult and infant mongoose lemur</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Haring</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Erin&nbsp;Ehmke <div class="imageTitle">Mongoose Lemur</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223388133_i_do_science_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223388133_i_do_science_poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="I do science"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223388133_i_do_science_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="I do science"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Duke Lemur Center poster for science education.</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Haring</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Erin&nbsp;Ehmke <div class="imageTitle">I do science</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223497255_Emf_pair--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223497255_Emf_pair--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Blue eyed black lemurs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223497255_Emf_pair--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Blue eyed black lemurs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Male and female blue eyed black lemurs sunning in our natural habitat enclosure</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Haring</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Erin&nbsp;Ehmke <div class="imageTitle">Blue eyed black lemurs</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223162433_Sunshine_just_hanging_in_NHE_5_2022--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223162433_Sunshine_just_hanging_in_NHE_5_2022--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Black & White Ruffed Lemur"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2012668/2012668_10698332_1704223162433_Sunshine_just_hanging_in_NHE_5_2022--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Black & White Ruffed Lemur"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sunshine just hanging in NHE 5</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Haring</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Erin&nbsp;Ehmke <div class="imageTitle">Black & White Ruffed Lemur</div> </div> </li></ul> </div> </div></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
