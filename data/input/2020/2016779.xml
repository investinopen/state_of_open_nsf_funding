<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[In nonhuman primate communities, between-species competition is hypothesized to dictate species diversity and community assemblages, but there is often a lack of fine-resolution data on species interactions. This doctoral dissertation project will use innovative methods to examine the relative influences of competition and niche differentiation on the structure of a community of four nocturnal lemurs from Madagascar. Species ecologies will be described in dietary, spatial, and temporal dimensions. The project will provide extant models for identifying driving forces in primate community evolutionary history as well as critical data for informed, targeted protection of endangered lemur species. The investigator will work with local NGOs to encourage sustainable development projects in the study region. Additionally, the investigator will engage women undergraduates, including from underrepresented groups, to work on arthropod curation and laboratory analyses and will visit high schools to give lectures about conservation and career paths for women in science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Competition is a primary mechanism underlying current community assemblages, particularly in sympatric, closely related species. The evolutionary history of lemurs was likely defined by such competition, resulting in pronounced niche differentiation, which allowed for coexistence in sympatric lemur communities. However, these concepts remain to be rigorously tested due to a lack of fine-resolution data regarding between-species interactions within lemur communities. To fully understand these processes, the investigator will combine innovative technologies, such as DNA metabarcoding, with traditional methods, such as transect surveys, to conduct a fine-resolution analysis of the relative influences of competition and niche differentiation on the structure of a sympatric community of nocturnal lemurs. Specifically, the investigator will evaluate: 1) niche differentiation and interspecific competition as governing forces of current cheirogaleid community structure, 2) which niche dimensions (i.e., diet, space, or time) most greatly facilitate coexistence and drive competition in this community, and 3) how niche differentiation shifts in response to seasonal variation (as some species exhibit hibernation/daily torpor during the dry season). Fine-resolution niche differentiation (i.e., differentiation that would have been undetectable using only traditional methods) is hypothesized to be responsible for the development and maintenance of the current assemblage of the study community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Around the world, nonhuman primates live in communities of varying complexities. This is particularly true in Madagascar, where a unique geographic history has led to endemic species living in elaborate communities. In these communities, between-species competition is hypothesized to dictate species diversity and community assemblages. However, a lack of fine-resolution data on species interactions had left these ideas untested. This doctoral dissertation project used innovative methods to address one overarching question: what are the relative influences of competition and niche differentiation (a division of resources in the habitat) on the structure of a community of four night-active lemurs from Madagascar?</p> <p>To investigate this question, we performed 8.5 months of biodiversity work in southwestern Madagascar. We conducted transect surveys throughout the night to understand space use in our study species. We completed 342 km of surveys, recording 1,859 lemur sightings of seven species. We performed live trapping and release to characterize the lemur population and understand the diet of the four study species. In total, we captured 140 individual lemurs of four species. During capture, we opportunistically collected fecal samples for dietary molecular analyses. To understand how forest community differences may drive differences in space use, we completed botanical surveys in 10 sites. Lastly, we collected weather data over eight months to understand how weather changes are associated with species niches.</p> <p>Following data collection, we performed molecular analyses on 378 lemur fecal samples from four species to identify the insects these lemurs consumed. We then performed statistical analyses to map our study species' spatial and dietary niches. We found the division of space to be an important mechanism for species coexistence in our study community. Lemur species divided space vertically (using different canopy layers) or horizontally across the landscape.&nbsp;</p> <p>We found insects to be an essential dietary resource for our study community. Our molecular analyses revealed insects in 99% of the feces we tested. Additionally, we recovered 723 unique insect dietary items. We found that insect consumption was primarily driven by resource availability. When resources were abundant, there was more overlap in lemur diets because there was less competition for insects. When resources were scarce, lemur diets had less overlap because there was more competition for insects. Our results showed that between-species competition likely drives species diversity in our study community. Additionally, our results exhibited the importance of fine-resolution data in understanding species coexistence.</p> <p>This project led to the professional development of individuals with diverse cultural and professional backgrounds. During this work, we have trained 28 Malagasy people (including two female Malagasy Ph.D. students), three Americans, and two Canadians. These individuals gained training and experience in reading and writing, English and Malagasy, leadership, research development, logistics, and technical skills that they can use in future jobs as research technicians, park guides, graduate students, and scientists. For example, one Malagasy Ph.D. student is now pursuing graduate school in the US, and one is completing her Ph.D. in Madagascar. Eight of our team members now have full-time jobs as either biodiversity technicians or with NGOs, two are working as park guides, and four are continuing their careers as park rangers.</p> <p>In addition to the biodiversity work, we conducted community assessments in five communities to aid in relationship development in nearby communities, promote long-term research in the area, and develop a research and conservation plan. Conservation action is critical in this area as lemurs are the most endangered mammal group in the world. We provided reports to the Malagasy government of the results from the biodiversity work and community assessments. These reports will be used to make informed decisions regarding targeted development and conservation plans within and around our study area. Additionally, our work was the first long-term research study in Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park. Through our work, we aided in developing positive local perceptions of scientific researchers and established relationships with community officials in the area. These relationships will help researchers in our and other disciplines who wish to complete research in this area in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>In primates, using small-bodied omnivorous species as models of early primate ancestors can aid in identifying the driving forces of primate community evolutionary history. The first true primates are suggested to be omnivorous, incorporating a significant portion of insects in their diet. By approaching the question of species coexistence through the investigation of fine-resolution partitioning of insects, our study moved far beyond the limitations of previous studies of dietary niche space in primate communities and provided key insights into how competition for arthropods may have led to the origin and maintenance of primate communities.&nbsp;By investigating highly endangered species that are representative of primates millions of years ago, we provided critical data for informed, targeted protection of lemur species that can aid in identifying driving forces in primate community evolutionary history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 12/11/2023<br> Modified by: Amanda&nbsp;K&nbsp;Rowe</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016779/2016779_10705293_1702312774980_Phaner--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016779/2016779_10705293_1702312774980_Phaner--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Phaner pallescens"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016779/2016779_10705293_1702312774980_Phaner--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Phaner pallescens"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Pale fork-marked lemur (Phaner pallescens).
