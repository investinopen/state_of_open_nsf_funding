<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award provides funding for participants in the Mid-Atlantic Topology Conference taking place April 18-19, 2020 at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. The conference focuses on a confluence of areas in algebraic topology that are currently at the forefront of research: arithmetic topology, chromatic homotopy theory, applied topology, manifold topology, and geometric representation theory. Priority for funding will be given to graduate students and to junior researchers without other funding sources, and among those to members of underrepresented groups in mathematics. Algebraic topology is enjoying a growing diversity, which this conference will foster through the selection of speakers and participants. This conference is quite timely in light of the research growth in algebraic topology seen on the East Coast in recent years and the resulting growth of student groups in the subject. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Modern algebraic topology is intimately tied to a host of fields. From Thom's thesis to the Madsen-Weiss theorem and beyond, stable homotopy theory has long played a crucial role in the study of manifolds. More recently, sophisticated techniques of equivariant stable homotopy theory were brought to bear in the solution of the Kervaire invariant problem concerning exotic smooth structures on spheres, opening new research directions and applications. On the other hand, homotopy theory is connected to algebraic geometry via motivic homotopy theory and applications such as those of abstract scissors congruence K-theory to the classical Grothendieck ring of varieties. Moreover, algebraic topology has seen notable recent application to the study of data in the emerging field of topological data analysis. One of the aims for this conference is to provide a sample of new directions in algebraic topology and interactions with other fields such as geometric topology, arithmetic geometry, and applied topology. The conference features nine 45-minute invited talks over two days. The scientific focus of the conference is decidedly forward-looking: the speakers are rising leaders in the field and include early career researchers; each speaker represents a distinct and vital aspect of the topology of the future.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Mid-Atlantic Topology Conference which took place at the Universityof Pennsylvania in the spring semester of 2023 fits into a recurring sequence of such conferenceson the east coast rotating between the University of Virginia, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Northeastern University.   The nine speakers at the 2023 Penn Mid-Atlantic topology conference presented on distinct and vital aspects of modern algebraictopology: groundbreaking advances in computations of the homotopy groups of spheres, one ofthe oldest and most venerable problems in the field, ongoing fusion of mathematical physics withaspects of topology such as low-dimensional topology and operadic algebra, quantum topology,stable homotopy theory and higher category theory, the recent explosion of activity surroundingthe application of topological methods to real-world problems, applications of homotopy theoryto mapping class groups, diffeomorphism groups, and characteristic classes of manifold bundles,cutting edge work on interactions between K-theory and algebraic geometry, and new advancesin scissors congruence K-theory of polyhedra. The conference has built a sense of community for the growing topology groups in the area by exposing graduate students to exciting new research while fostering interactions that often lead to collaborations. We had a diverse group of speakers hailing from a mix ofprivate and public institutions, who presented a large breadth of backgrounds and research topics.
