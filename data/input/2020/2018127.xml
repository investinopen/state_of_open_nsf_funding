<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop technology to make the low-altitude airspace more accessible for commercial drone delivery operations while ensuring a high level of operational safety and efficiency. Large-scale, organized deployment of delivery drones can unlock substantial efficiency gain in transportation systems in terms of reduced road congestion, reduced CO2 emission; in addition, it would offer health and convenience benefits to senior citizens, the ill, and mobility-challenged members of society. However, existing drone delivery practices are limited in scope, scale, and operating conditions due to inefficient air traffic management (ATM) paradigms. This project aims to discover a viable business model for translating technological innovations in unmanned ATM into an operable, city-scale, fully automated drone delivery system. The proposed system would allow safe use of the low-altitude airspace at an unprecedented density and efficiency, generating enormous savings for last-mile deliveries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the development of a suite of novel optimization-driven algorithms in the areas of motion-planning, dynamic vehicle routing, communication and risk minimization to provide real-time ATM and trajectory control for a cooperative fleet of drones navigating a shared airspace. Existing ATM methods leave excessive separation margins due to human-level response time and control dexterity. In contrast, the proposed new system is optimized for high-density air traffic conditions, offering the capability to generate real-time adjustments to 4D flight trajectories, tolerating a smaller separation margin, and overseeing safe execution of control commands across the fleet. In a plug-and-play fashion, the proposed system will turn a collection of heterogeneous multicopter drones into an organized and intelligent fleet. The competitive advantage lies in the fusion of the state-of-the-art operations research (OR) models and algorithms onto drone platforms via commoditized cloud computing, IoT and communication infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
