<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Ohio University is acquiring a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight, mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) equipped with direct analysis in real time (DART) sources to support Professor Stephen Bergmeier and colleagues Eric Masson, Justin Holub, Amir Farnoud and Jessica White. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and region. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. The MALDI-TOF-MS is also used in outreach activities involving students from Appalachian Ohio and faculty from a number of liberal arts colleges in southeast Ohio including: Marietta College, Shawnee State University and the University of Rio Grande.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the characterization of synthesized organic and medicinal compounds. The instrumentation is used for developing peptide-based ligands that modulate therapeutically-relevant signal transduction pathways in cells. In addition, it benefits the exploration of supramolecular chemistry using macrocycles of the curcubit[n]uril family and the use of inorganic compounds as photochemotherapeutics and their interactions with DNA. The mass spectrometer is used to understand mechanisms through which nanomaterials disrupt the plasma membrane and for measuring and imaging chemicals on solid surfaces. The MALDI spectrometer is also employed in studies of phenol-soluble modulins which have potential uses as antibiotics, and in screening synthetic or natural polymers, metal complexes, bacterial strains, complex carbohydrates and synthetic inorganic compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>NSF-MRI funds were used to purchase and install a Bruker Daltonics AutoFlex Max matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer along with an HTX TM-Sprayer MALDI Sample Preparation System, a Bruker TissueScout tissue scanner/slide imager, and an Ametek Powervar Series 3kVA UPS. Software packages included BioPharma Compass v2021b data mining platform (Bruker Daltonics); Biotools protein analysis package (Bruker Daltonics), and Mascot Server v2.7 search engine (Matrix Science). The instrument was installed in March 2021 and has been fully operational since May 2023. Unfortunately, recurring issues with the instrument hardware compounded by supply delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted instrument productivity for the first two years following its installation. Nevertheless, the instrument is now working at full capacity and is currently being used by over 60 graduate students across four (4) colleges at Ohio University, and three (3) primary investigators outside Ohio University. This use has resulted in 12 published abstracts presented at scientific meetings and two (2) peer-reviewed publications. Moreover, we have recently expanded the use of the MALDI instrument beyond basic mass spectrometry to include advanced techniques such as MALDI imaging, polymer analysis, and bacterial phenotyping. Notably, several collaborations have been initiated as a result of these advanced protocols. Many projects from diverse fields across the university, including biochemistry, chemical biology, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, chemical engineering, medicinal chemistry, and clinical research are now benefitting from this instrument. The MALDI has also been a key component of the new chemical instrumentation core facility housed in Ohio University&rsquo;s new chemistry building (completed in 2021). In total, the MALDI-TOF spectrometer has run over 3,000 samples during the past 18 months (despite nearly two years of intermittent downtime due to hardware and supply issues). In summary, this has been a very successful project overall and we are looking forward to years of productive use of the MALDI-TOF instrument.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 12/13/2023<br> Modified by: Justin&nbsp;Holub</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
