<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award permits the University of Alabama to acquire a 3.0 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system. Establishing an MRI research facility at UA will be a significant new direction in human neuroscience research at UA as well as allow for collaboration with other institutions on large multi-site projects. A neuroimaging facility at UA will provide a much-needed boost to the neuroscience initiatives (e.g., graduate research in neuroscience, undergraduate neuroscience minor, undergraduate and graduate programs in educational neuroscience) at UA. The 3.0T MRI system will have a lasting impact on the field beyond the specific projects that will be initially supported and advanced. Most importantly, sharing a critical research tool like the MRI scanner creates a platform to accelerate conceptual and methodological development across neuroimaging laboratories, capitalizing on the exceptional pool of talent available at UA and other universities in the region. Building a neuroimaging research environment will be a catalyst for training undergraduate and graduate students interested in neuroscience research, including women and underrepresented minority students. This will also provide opportunities for training students from historically black colleges nearby, such as Stillman College and other such universities in the state of Alabama. Establishing a neuroimaging environment at UA will, in addition to facilitating neuroscience research, provide opportunities for the surrounding rural communities to participate in research as well as students from rural areas in Alabama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed MRI system will stimulate interdisciplinary collaborative research projects at the basic and translational levels at UA. The following research projects at UA will utilize the MRI system: 1) Multiscale neural processing and the neurobiology of language processing and reading comprehension in healthy individuals and in disorders; 2) Developing brain algorithms to improve natural language processing; 3) Neurobiological bases of mathematical cognition, with specific emphasis on embodiment of number and arithmetic; 4) Examining the cognitive and neural changes associated with healthy aging, memory and attention; 5) Investigating lifetime stress, brain aging, and the racial differences underlying brain aging; 6) Biomedical imaging analysis and development of shape-controlled magnetic nanoparticles for MRI; and 7) Developmental neurobiology of social brain in healthy individuals and in disorders. The MRI system will enhance the collaboration across different schools, colleges and departments at UA, including Psychology, Education, Communicative Disorders, Biological Sciences, and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary outcome of the NSF MRI Award was the successful acquisition of a Siemens 3 Tesla Prisma MRI Scanner which was installed at the University of Alabama Campus in Tuscaloosa Alabama. An MRI Center was built where the scanned was placed, and the Center and Scanner were operational from November 2022. Establishing this MRI Researrch facility has provided a significant new direction for human neuroscience research at UA as well as for collaboration with other institutions on large multisite projects. New collaborative federally funded projects have been funded since the scanner was purchased. The MRI facility has also provided a much-needed boost to the neuroscience initiatives (e.g., graduate research in neuroscience, undergraduate neuroscience minor, undergraduate and graduate programs in educational neuroscience) at UA. The brand new Undergraduate Neuroscience major was operational from Fall 2023. Building a neuroimaging research environment is acting as a catalyst for training undergraduate and graduate students interested in neuroscience research, including women and underrepresented minority students. This is also providing opportunities for training students from historically black colleges nearby, such as Stillman College and other such universities in the state of Alabama. In addition to facilitating neuroscience research on campus, the MRI center is expected to provide opportunities for the surrounding rural communities to participate in research and also students from rural areas in Alabama to undertake neuroscience research. Below is a list of a few collaborative neuroimaging projects at different stages (ongoing, in prepartion, about to complete) at the UA MRI Center:&nbsp;1) Multiscale neural processing and the neurobiology of language processing and reading comprehension in healthy individuals and in disorders; 2) Developing brain algorithms to improve natural language processing; 3) Neurobiological bases of mathematical cognition, with specific emphasis on embodiment of number and arithmetic; 4) Examining the cognitive and neural changes associated with healthy aging, memory and attention; 5) Investigating lifetime stress, brain aging, and the racial differences underlying brain aging; 6) Biomedical imaging analysis and development of shape-controlled magnetic nanoparticles for MRI; and 7) Developmental neurobiology of social brain in healthy individuals and in disorders. The MRI system will enhance the collaboration across different schools, colleges and departments at UA, including Psychology, Education, Communicative Disorders, Biological Sciences, and Engineering. At this point neuroimagers at UA, Auburn University, and UAB are actively in discussions about collaborative grant applications. These institutions, along with collaborations with Vanderbilt and Emory University can have a significant impact on the neuroscience frontier in the Southeast region and further. Rural population in many parts of states like Alabama has been largely out of the world of research due to several reasons. Cutting edge neuroscience research at UA and nearby universities can provide a venue for such population to participate in research. Since this involves cognitive evaluation, assessment, and referral in some cases, they can find the resources needed for their difficulties and needs. Finally, training opportunities in neuroscience for minority and underrepresented students (graduate, undergraduate, and high school to college transition students), and women will improve significantly as more and more innovative neuroimaging projects are in the works.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 01/30/2024<br> Modified by: Rajesh&nbsp;Kana</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2019120/2019120_10703748_1706644765446_UA_MRI--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2019120/2019120_10703748_1706644765446_UA_MRI--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UA MRI Scanner"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2019120/2019120_10703748_1706644765446_UA_MRI--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UA MRI Scanner"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Siemens 3 Tesla Prisma Scanner at the University of Alabama MRI Center</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rajesh Kana</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rajesh&nbsp;Kana <div class="imageTitle">UA MRI Scanner</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2019120/2019120_10703748_1706644857986_20230306_123047--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2019120/2019120_10703748_1706644857986_20230306_123047--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Training"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2019120/2019120_10703748_1706644857986_20230306_123047--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Training"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students in training at the University of Alabama MRI Center</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rajesh Kana</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rajesh&nbsp;Kana <div class="imageTitle">Training</div> </div> </li></ul> </div> </div></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
