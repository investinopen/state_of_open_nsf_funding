<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project establishes a computing system that assists researchers at San Diego State University to accelerate their work through ongoing developments in computer processing hardware.  Faculty and students will develop code, most of it currently running on traditional processing units, to take advantage of the enhanced computing power of graphical processing units and field programmable gate arrays, which effectively allow the circuitry of the computer chip to be optimized for specific computing tasks.  Applications hosted on this system include simulations of subterranean carbon dioxide sequestration, the development of new computer programs to identify disease-causing and other organisms in biologically diverse environments, and studies of nuclear structure, brain imaging, the motion of viruses, and engine design.  One of the PIs directs the training of new users, and the infrastructure is incorporated into several courses available to undergraduates and graduate students.  External users can access the resource through the Pacific Research Platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new, high-performance computing cluster offers advanced processor hardware to researchers at San Diego State University and throughout the region. The cluster is optimized to support transfer of existing software developed in-house to processors that promote distributed computing and/or electronic design automation. While accelerating projects and modernizing training in computational methods, this work also informs the University’s long-range cyberinfrastructure acquisition plans by quantifying the enhancement of research possible with advanced hardware. 20% of the cluster capacity is reserved for extramural use through the Pacific Research Platform, and 5% for training and coursework to advance workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This grant funded the purchase of a new high performance computer cluster, designated DGX, for San Diego State University's Computational Sciences Research Center (CSRC), an interdisciplinary program bringing together faculty and students from some 12 departments spanning the sciences, engineering, business, and public health. Theprimary goal of DGX is the support of CSRC members developing software for advanced hardware or porting legacy code from traditional CPUs to graphical processing units (GPUs). The recent addition of a 2-petabyte storage server will expand the capability of DGX to host calculations involving very large datasets.   The variety of research carried out on the new cluster reflects the wide range of interests of the faculty at the CSRC. The 14 papers published to date in the peer-reviewed scientific literature include studies of the flow of ocean currents in three dimensions, the design of catalysts for the improved production of fine chemicals, and the programming of wearable technology to protect against falls. Other ongoing projects include measuring the effectiveness of a new construct for making Fortran code compatible with GPUs and the simulation of a strategy for underground carbon sequestration.    DGX has enhanced the training opportunities for our students by hosting the projects for a workshop on programming for advanced computing, and for two courses: an engineering course on accelerated computing, and a computational chemistry course. The cluster is now the single principal high-performance computing resource for students in our graduate program. We anticipate that DGX will facilitate the preparation of our students for careers in advanced computing, including applications in data science and machine learning, for the next decade.
