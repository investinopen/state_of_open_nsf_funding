<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will develop a blueprint for a future artificial intelligence (AI) institute that will study the foundations of intelligence across a broad array of natural and technological systems.  Given the pervasiveness of AI technologies in everyday life and the expected increased impact of these technologies in upcoming decades, it is imperative that AI researchers develop more reliable, general, and adaptable systems, ones that are trustworthy and that can more successfully collaborate with humans. New breakthroughs in AI research are most likely to come from concentrated collaborative efforts between AI specialists and researchers who think deeply about the nature of intelligence in different disciplines.  Via focused workshops, seminars, and numerous education and outreach activities, this project will bring together experts from a broad swath of disciplines to map out ways in which insights from intelligent systems in nature can inform and inspire AI progress.  The results will be disseminated via workshop reports and educational materials, and, most importantly, a detailed proposal for an institute that would advance AI through a broader and deeper view of intelligence, both natural and artificial, taking the time to formulate longer-term questions and approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this planning project are to (1) map out the important research themes, questions, methods, and applications that would be the topics of the prospective institute, as well as the needed infrastructure; (2) build research collaborations and perform preliminary research; (3) plan for how the institute will engage with the overall national and international AI community, and for the institute’s education and outreach programs. This two-year planning project will explore five research themes that are central to the study of intelligence and representative of the kinds of interdisciplinary problems that the envisioned AI institute would address: &lt;br/&gt;1. A Taxonomy of Intelligence across Disciplines; &lt;br/&gt;2. Development and Life History of Intelligent Systems; &lt;br/&gt;3. Concept Formation, Abstraction, and Analogy; &lt;br/&gt;4. Collective Intelligence; &lt;br/&gt;5. Evolutionary and Co-Evolutionary Intelligence.     &lt;br/&gt;These themes will be explored in numerous workshops, project meetings, and educational and outreach activities that will bring together researchers from diverse disciplines to map out questions and methods as well as to engage in preliminary research driven by these questions.  The results of all of these activities will be summarized in publicly available reports, and synthesized in a detailed blueprint for an envisioned AI institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project was to develop a set of themes and build collaborative teams for an NSF AI Institute proposal on the foundations of intelligence in biological and AI systems. The motivation of this work is to gain insight into the principles of intelligence in order to guide the development of more robust and general AI. Such insights can be gained only via concentrated collaborative efforts between AI specialists and researchers who think deeply about the nature of intelligence in different disciplines.    In order to develop the main themes and teams for our AI Institute proposal, we organized and ran a series of workshops on broad issues related to biological and machine intelligence. The workshops that we held during the grant period were the following:      &#9679; Foundations of Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems   &#9679; Frontiers of Evolutionary Computation   &#9679; Collective Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems   &#9679; Real Patterns in Science and Cognition   &#9679; Can Algorithms Bend the Arc Toward Justice?   &#9679; Embodied, Situated, and Grounded Intelligence: Implications for AI   &#9679; Artificial Intelligence and the Barrier of Meaning 2      Each of these workshops brought together between 30 and 60 scholars from different fields, including AI, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and several other disciplines, for talks, discussion, and collaboration planning. The workshops helped us arrive at the specific themes and research projects we included in the AI Institute proposal we submitted in 2022. As part of this project, we wrote (or are in the process of writing) detailed reports of six of these workshops, and made these reports publicly available on our project webpage, https://intelligence.santafe.edu. We also made public many videos of talks from these workshops on the Santa Fe Institute's YouTube channel. In addition, during the grant period the PI, Co-PI, and other project personnel published over a dozen scholarly papers related to the workshop themes, and gave dozens of publicly accessible lectures on the topics related to the project.    Integral to our project was the training and professional development of young scientists. In addition to a project postdoc, we included several graduate and undergraduate students in our workshop organization and research collaborations. We also developed a new interdisciplinary educational initiative that integrates computer science, law, and social science to advance understanding of algorithmic justice at the University of New Mexico.     The intellectual merit and broader impacts of the project arose from the in-depth cross-disciplinary discussions, collaborations, and educational and public outreach initiatives fostered by our project. Through these activities, we gained new insights and made plans for future research on central questions related to intelligence in general, on aspects of intelligent behavior that so far elude the most successful AI systems, and on societal issues around implementing robust, general, and adaptive intelligence in machines.
