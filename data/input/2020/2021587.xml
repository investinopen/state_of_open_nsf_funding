<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research, approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings. There are few empirical studies of sustained youth engagement in STEM-oriented making over time, how youth are supported in working towards more robust STEM related projects, on the outcomes of such making experiences among youth from historically marginalized communities, or on the design features of making experiences which support these goals. The project plans to conduct a set of research studies to develop: a theory-based and data-driven framework for equitably consequential making; a set of related individual-level and program-level cases with exemplars (and the associated challenges) that can be used by researchers and practitioners for guiding the field; and an initial set of guiding principles (with indicators) for identifying equitably consequential making in practice. The project will result in a framework for equitably consequential making with guiding principles for implementation that will contribute to the infrastructure for fostering increased opportunities to learn among all youth, especially those historically underrepresented in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through research, the project seeks to build capacity among STEM-oriented maker practitioners, researchers and youth in the maker movement around equitably consequential making to expand the prevailing norms of making towards more transformative outcomes for youth. Project research will be guided by several questions.  What do youth learn and do (in-the-moment and over time) in making spaces that work to support equity in making? What maker space design features support (or work against) youth in making in equitably consequential ways? What are the individual and community outcomes youth experience in STEM-making across settings and time scales? What are the most salient indicators of equitably consequential making, how do they take shape, how can these indicators be identified in practice? The project will research these questions using interview studies and critical longitudinal ethnography with embedded youth participatory case study methodologies. The research will be conducted in research-practice partnerships involving Michigan State University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and 4 local, STEM- and youth-oriented making spaces in Lansing and Greensboro that serve historically underrepresented groups in STEM, with a specific focus on youth from lower-income and African American backgrounds.]]></AbstractNarration>

This project investigated how and why youth innovate unique solutions to address particular inequities in their lives, and the associated design features which expand opportunities to make.      At the heart of Equitably Consequential Making were a set of longitudinal studies conducted focused on developing a a) theory-based and data-driven framework for equitably consequential making, b) set of cases with exemplars of equitably consequential making (and the associated challenges) that can be used by researchers and practitioners for guiding the field (cases focus both on the individual and programmatic levels); and c) set of indicators for identifying equitably consequential making in practice.      Specific attention was paid to how designs of STEM-rich maker experiences facilitated minoritized youths equitable and consequential making. We operationalized equitable and consequential making as contingent on dialogic iteration exhibiting the following features:   1)  Evidence of deep STEM and making knowledges & practices;   2)  Evidence of authentic community wisdom locally and as nested within broader social issues;   3)  Evidence of impact of made artifacts that support transformativeoutcomes at the individual and community level focused on learning, becoming and doing in STEM through sustained engagement in making.         All work was conducted in Research and Practice Partnerships involving the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro along with four local, STEM- and youth-oriented makerspaces in Lansing and Greensboro.

In addition, the project involved over 100 youth makers and about 16 adult mentors across our sites in in-depth ethnographic case studies of youth and programs.      Equitably Consequential Making yielded a framework and exemplar case studies and counter cases for equitably consequential making that contribute to the infrastructure for broadening participation among all youth in making.          The equity-driven framework illustrates how the culture of STEM-rich maker programs is foundational to advancing equity, especially in relation to underrepresented youths opportunities to make and learn in their local contexts, as grounded in their local community concerns and desires.

The project also found that soliciting for community wisdom and funds of knowledge is a continuous process grounded in authentic relationships and iterative responses in the STEM-rich making process. In addition, this cultural lens has become central to a recent and growing body of equity-oriented studies in the field. The framework and cases contribute to transforming the culture of the maker movement by including the voices and perspectives of youth from historically underrepresented communities and their adult facilitators through our choice of contexts and methodologies.
