<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award will enable the Morton Arboretum to design a Biology Integration Institute that will take a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and predicting whole tree responses to rapid environmental changes, including emerging climates, biotic invasions, and urbanization, across organizational (i.e., from molecules to ecosystems) and temporal scales (i.e., from moments to generations). Trees shape terrestrial environments, both in natural and built environments, creating forests and woodlands and play a major role in global water, carbon, nutrient, and energy cycles. With their extensive root systems and expansive leaf canopies, they integrate above and below ground conditions, linking the soil and sky through a dynamic biotic system.  Tree responses to these emerging novel environments - be it an urban parkway or an increasingly dry woodland - also alter the environment they live in and generate biological innovations in traits, genes, behavior, community composition, and clades. A synthetic approach is necessary to understand these complex and contingent systems and tease apart questions of nature versus nurture and how we might best manage trees in the future. During the Design phase, the project will enhance the current undergraduate research and public outreach activities of the institution, especially with regard to individuals who are underrepresented in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trees, as a growth form, are a great model system for integrative biology and the study of biotic response to environmental change. Not only do they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and form the fundamental ecological and evolutionary basis for many ecosystems, they possess numerous compelling biological characteristics making them particularly good integrators of environmental change. The researchers will design a Biological Integration Institute focused on the theme of “how trees respond to and shape novel environments.” They will leverage the unique research and training resources of a large public botanic garden encompassing urban, managed, restored, and remnant ecosystems. In the Design phase, the researchers in the Center for Tree Science will work with internal and external experts to: 1) Clarify a core overarching question, identify opportunities for synergy in existing projects, and prioritize new cross-disciplinary collaborative research teams and projects; 2) Create a management plan and strategies for data integration and collaboration that allow for interdisciplinary cross-talk, including designing an integrative database that builds on lessons from prior NSF investments; and 3) how to leverage the Arboretum’s existing integrated training and mentorship program in tree science, which prepares students and early career scientists for interdisciplinary, collaborative careers across a range of fields and agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      This project sought to develop integrative biological research questions and projects using trees and the strengths of botanical collections and garden institutions as grounding concepts. From this, we identified a theme of Terrestrial Responses to Emerging Environments Temporally Integrated from Moments to Eons (TREETIME) wherein phenology  the study of recurring life history events  was used as a unifying concept to connect individual, sub-seasonal responses to weather to evolutionary-scale patterns of diversification across the tree of life.   Our BII design process targeted approaches to form new collaborations and through an open call for design participants, although the COVID-19 epidemic shifted our original plans to become an entirely online collaboration in 2020 and 2021. The design phase of our project engaged 40 individuals from 33 unique organizations, with the final BII Implementation proposal submitted in January 2022 consisting of 25 PIs or senior personnel representing 20 organizations.   Although the proposal was not funded in 2022, the team science-driven BII design process had substantial positive impacts on the participants. Through social network analysis performed by our team science consultants, we were able to identify that participants made an average of ten new professional connections and began discussing other spin-off collaborations with an average of four new individuals. Participants also reported having gained, on average, one new mentor through our BII design process.   Our BII design process also included a high proportion of early career investigators, many of whom developed team science, collaboration, and leadership skills through virtual workshops and training provided by this project. These skills have been applied to other grant and investigative teams, including those that have received NSF funding.   The collaborations and scientific ideas formed as part of this BII design project are continuing beyond the lifespan of grant funding. Two manuscripts are in preparation, and the concepts proposed in 2022 are being refined with an interdisciplinary team for submission to the 2025 BII competition or other NSF programs.
