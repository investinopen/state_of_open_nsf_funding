<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will investigate the impact of volcanism on the development and trajectories of past societies. Disasters are typically framed as externalized crises which pass judgment on a society’s resilience. However, these narratives often ignore how disaster reveals underlying tensions and inequalities, and how disaster is capitalized upon for systemic change within social fields. This project will examine how trends of shifting social organization, power distribution, and a society’s priorities are amplified in the context of disaster. Disasters can open new means and motivations to divert or accelerate social trends: communities can choose to communally support each other through bottom-up organization schemes, just as institutions and their leaders can seek to entrench their power and control through top-down administration. Each person also has a unique social and environmental exposure to the hazard itself, which informs the decisions they make to maintain or alter their behavior, or even leave the affected landscape entirely and emigrate. These contestations and negotiations play out along already-established social conventions and power dynamics – and their consequences establish expectations for how to respond to future disasters. Studying disaster-affected societies through this lens contributes to understanding of the development of social complexity. This research also deepens a growing literature on the role of disaster in the human experience, and helps illustrate how modern society can contend with our own increasing number of disasters worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines one specific aspect of disaster and society, that of the impact of volcanism in a coastal region. It was impacted several times by volcanic eruptions that began in the highlands and deposited volcanic ash (tephra) widely but unevenly. This presents the opportunity to complement and expand on interpretations of regional volcanic exposure and its interaction with trajectories of social complexity. Investigation will take place at a site which preserves stratified occupations in domestic features like house floors, storage pits and hearths. Excavation and site survey will recover ceramic, lithic, paleoecological, and biological material correlates to assess if residents altered their land use and social arrangements; and will also identify tephra related to source and time of eruptions. These correlates will support rigorous, interdisciplinary interpretations which discuss the social-ecological dimensions of disaster through time. Understanding how these communities negotiated volcanic vulnerability broadens archaeological discussions of alternative social complexity, and aids modern communities exposed to these volcanic hazards by learning from past events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF DDIG award was given with the intent of continuing ongoing archaeological investigations into the R&iacute;o Grande de Chone, in Manab&iacute;, Ecuador. These investigations included site survey and excavation of a candidate site on the southern side of the river valley, in the R&iacute;o Platanales tributary drainage of the valley. The project&rsquo;s particular focus is on the first-millennium BC occupations of pre-Columbian societies of the Chorrera tradition, and evidence of those societies&rsquo; exposures to volcanic eruptions from the central highlands some two hundred kilometers to the east, particularly with the presence and extent of tephra (volcanic ash). The project&rsquo;s goal is to fruitfully enrich how archaeologists evaluate ancient disaster not only along ecological dimensions but social ones as well.</p> <p>A candidate site identified in 2018 project survey, known as Platanales (for the nearby <em>pueblo</em> of the same name), would make for a suitable site given the project&rsquo;s goals (Figure 1). The project secured permissions from private landowners, community leaders, and Ecuadorian authorities to excavate and survey the site from roughly mid-September 2021 through mid-September 2022. During two excavation seasons of Sep-Dec 2021 and Jun-Aug 2022, the project opened over 120 square meters of exposure across seven operations. The NSF DDIG described here funded airfare travel for both seasons by the co-PI, and fieldwork funding for nearly the entire September-December 2021 season of excavation. Supplemental funding for both seasons was provided by the co-PI&rsquo;s institution, Yale University, through internal grant funding from the Albers Travel Fund.</p> <p>The site of Platanales presents as a series of wide, low terraces with domestic <em>tolas</em> (mounds) scattered along many of them, along both sides of the tributary. In one sector, a larger <em>tola</em> of roughly twenty by sixty meters, three meters high, was also identified. These domestic mounds are the agglomeration of house floors occupied over many centuries. Trench 1, the primary operation of the 2021 season, was a 2x15m operation which excavated one of these house floor agglomerates in its northern end; expansions at this end of the trench expanded to cover roughly half of the total floor area (roughly 5x5m) of this structure (Figure 2). Within each successive house floor ceramic, lithic, ochre, and obsidian artifacts were recovered. In particular, the ceramic sherds embedded in these floors indicated that the structure was continually occupied, built, and rebuilt several times. These occupations occurred over a period extending from the later local Chorrera ceramic tradition (Tabuchila 2, ca. 400 BC) through a transitional ceramic phase, and into the early local Jama-Coaque ceramic tradition (Muchique 1 and 2, ca. AD 500). The first of these occupational floors held a tephra-laden soil within it. Laboratory analysis of this tephra is ongoing, but it is suspected to be linked to the eruption of Pululagua, circa 467 BC; this identification speaks directly to questions of reoccupation and site revival after the eruption.</p> <p>Other contexts encountered at Platanales included house floors with late Valdivia occupations (ca. 2100-1800 BC), at the beginnings of the site&rsquo;s occupation, and early Jama-Coaque structures (ca 300 BC-AD 500). Excavations in 2022 also investigated part of the large 20x60m <em>tola</em> mentioned above. Specifically, Trench 4 encountered a shrine capped with a monumental stone spiral within the mound. The northeast and southwest sides of the mound also appeared to incorporate a stairstep design. While this architecture was too close to the surface to successfully carbon-date, on stratigraphic grounds it appears to have been constructed during the second millennium BC, well before Chorrera occupations. A distinct tephra layer was also found on the windward side of the mound. The mound&rsquo;s stairstep aspect suggests the mounded architectural traditions of the Peruvian coast, while its stone spiral implies connections to spiral ritual architecture from the Amazon of southern Ecuador and northern Peru. Precious few <em>tolas</em> have been systematically excavated on the Ecuadorian coast to date.</p> <p>This project has contributed a wealth of new insights into the social lives of pre-Columbian societies living in what is now coastal Ecuador. Its ceramic, lithic, architectural, and ecofactual data, currently being analyzed as part of the co-PI&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation, give archaeologists contextual evidence of a village occupied over three millennia and contending with disastrous conditions in ancient Manab&iacute;. This project&rsquo;s fieldwork and analysis are providing a deepening respect that modern communities of the R&iacute;o Grande are building with their heritage and the accomplishments that their ancestors provided to them. In 2021 and 2022 the project began community discussions and school trips to teach about archaeology and this local heritage for local children, and has begun supporting local ceramics studios and the artisans which still work with traditional methods and local clay. Through these and other new dialogues instigated by fieldwork and community collaboration, the descendants of these remarkable pre-Columbian societies are finding ways to connect with their forebears.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 11/20/2023<br> Modified by: Corey&nbsp;Herrmann</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023376/2023376_10686195_1700505905635_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023376/2023376_10686195_1700505905635_Figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023376/2023376_10686195_1700505905635_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Excavations at the north end of Trench 1, where superimposed occupational floors of Chorrera and Jama-Coaque occupations were encountered.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Corey Herrmann</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Corey&nbsp;Herrmann <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023376/2023376_10686195_1700505153172_DSC_0595--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023376/2023376_10686195_1700505153172_DSC_0595--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023376/2023376_10686195_1700505153172_DSC_0595--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The site of Platanales from the south.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Corey Herrmann</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Corey&nbsp;Herrmann <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li></ul> </div> </div></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
