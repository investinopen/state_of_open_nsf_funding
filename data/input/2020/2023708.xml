<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The boundary between productive coastal waters and relatively non-productive offshore waters is not a simple function of distance from the coast, but is determined by a complex interplay between biology, chemistry, and ocean physics.  This interplay is a fundamental property that controls the oceanic contribution to the food supply and the global carbon cycle.   During summer months when waters are warmer with low oxygen, biological decomposition near the seafloor consumes available oxygen and releases iron from sediments into overlying seawater.  In deeper parts of the ocean, canyons and other rugged surface features influence currents and create turbulence that rapidly moves iron from the shelf offshore. This iron in turn can enhance biological productivity miles away. This project will investigate (1) how decomposition processes on the continental shelf seafloor release elements like iron required for ocean life and (2) how ocean currents interact with the continental shelf and slope to move waters overlying the shelf offshore to enhance productivity.  Based on model simulations from the California and Oregon coasts done over 20 years that show transport of iron via plumes from the shelf to the open ocean, scientists will collect and analyze samples for iron and iodine to prove the findings of the model.  Iodine has been included in the study because it can track inputs from low oxygen sediments to the shelf.  In addition, results from the study will be used to improve assumptions used in the current model.  The project will support the research in whole or in part of four graduate students and several undergraduate students.  The scientists are involved with High School student mentoring, through Project COOL (Chemical Oceanography Outside the Lab) and the Students on Ice Foundation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Scientists from the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles will study iron (Fe) and iodine (I) geochemistry along the Washington and Oregon Coasts, where high organic matter oxidation rates, low dissolved oxygen concentrations, and high sedimentary Fe fluxes on the continental shelf occur. This project hypothesizes that a shelf-to-basin shuttle controls the supply of Fe from the Fe-rich shelf into the interior of the North Pacific Ocean.  Simulations of a Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) coupled with the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling model (BEC) run between 2007-2017 showed that this coastline is a major source of Fe to the ocean basin, exhibiting both deep and shallow Fe plumes that arise from subsurface eddies generated by poleward undercurrents.  Results from this model will be used to predict how the distribution of Fe evolves seasonally and guide sampling during  two cruises in 2021 to the region.  According to the ROMS-BEC model, the Fe inventory is highest in late summer, when bottom water oxygen is lowest, and the inventory is lowest in winter and early spring.  Model-generated deep plumes resemble those reported off Namibia, Peru and the Gulf of Alaska. This work will sample depths up to 4500m and look for such plumes. Deep plumes are important in global Fe budgets and because they may outcrop in high latitude waters that are Fe limited.  Iodine will also be measured because, like Fe, it accumulates at the sediment water interface and is released under reducing conditions.   Plumes of iodine arising from shelf sediments will be used as a semi-conservative tracer for lateral Fe advection.  The cruises will also assess the relative importance of direct inputs from rivers (especially the Columbia River) versus reducing sediments, since these inputs are decoupled seasonally&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  James Moffett (USC) and Daniele Bianchi (UCLA) investigated the distribution of iron (Fe) along the Oregon Coast on two research cruises in 2021. The composition of seawater in coastal waters is much different than the open oceans. Nutrients are much higher in coastal waters, stimulating high productivity. Indeed, Oregon coastal waters are among the most productive fisheries in North America. There are big gradients in ocean chemistry in the boundaries between the coastal waters and blue waters of the open ocean. No gradients are larger than those of iron, a critical micronutrient. But what controls where these boundaries are? Our research revealed that the extent of high iron penetration into the offshore ocean is determined by the interaction of coastal ocean physics and chemistry at the seafloor of the continental shelf. Strong currents flow northwards along the outer edge of the continental shelf. They interact with submarine canyons and other features to generate turbulent eddies that move vast amounts of water offshore. Our models showed that there are three hotspots of high transport along the Oregon coast that could account for half of the offshore transport. The other requirement is hypoxia (absence of oxygen) on the adjacent shelf. Previous workers showed that the amount of iron coming out of shelf sediments is much higher under hypoxic conditions. Our findings confirmed this prediction. Moreover, we found that at least two of the hotspots are near hypoxic zones, with high standing stocks of iron in coastal waters with strong offshore eddies. Hypoxia in Oregon is an increasing problem that is greatest in the summer. This is also the time when subsurface eddy generation is highest. Therefore, transport of iron (and other materials on the shelf) is greatest during this period. Broader impacts of the project are both global and local. The results help oceanographers to determine the amount of iron and other elements (including organic and inorganic carbon) from the continental margin to offshore waters. The data can be used to develop budgets, enabling us to determine how these elements are cycled globally. The results have an important local impact as well, enabling us to predict how future changes in hypoxia and inputs of iron from the continent will affect the Oregon coastal ecosystem.
