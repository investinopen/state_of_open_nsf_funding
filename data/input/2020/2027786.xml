<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will develop a set of mathematical models of the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. The 2019-2020 global coronavirus pandemic is ongoing. Much remains unknown about the epidemic trajectory and potential paths to containment. The researchers will map the spatial spread of the virus, estimate key parameters related to transmission, compile clinical and epidemiological information, and assess the effectiveness of public health interventions on containment. In doing so the work will develop concepts and mathematical theory essential for the understanding of the spread of COVID-19 with possible applications to other emerging infectious diseases. The proposed work will provide estimates of key epidemiological parameters necessary for understanding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency, in particular, and the future control of other emerging zoonosis. This research will provide timely information on the COVID-19 epidemic immediately useful to the operations of the CDC, as well as contribute to the training of two graduate students and a postdoc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of this project are, first, to contextualize COVID-19 in comparison to previous outbreaks of infectious respiratory diseases and estimate infectiousness, incubation period, transmissibility, case severity, and case fatality rate. Second, it will estimate and visualize epidemiological parameters for COVID-19, including: the epidemic curve, the basic reproduction number (R0), the case detection rate, the incubation period, transmissibility, and the lag between symptom onset and isolation. Third, it will develop and parameterize a U.S. spatial model to help determine the optimal allocation of resources such as personnel, funding, supplies at multiple spatial scales such as states, cities, and hospitals. Fourth, it will fit stochastic dynamical models to case notification data to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions such as lockdowns, curfews, and school closures. These aims will be accomplished by leveraging public, crowd-sourced, and government data with stochastic dynamical models for transmission and spatial spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual Merit   Understanding COVID-19 in Context   Our research began by comparing COVID-19 to past respiratory disease outbreaks. We looked at how infectious the virus is, how long it takes for symptoms to appear (incubation period), how easily it spreads (transmissibility), the severity of cases, and the rate of death among those infected (case fatality rate). This comparison helps us understand the unique challenges posed by COVID-19.   Tracking the Epidemic in Real-Time   We developed methods to estimate crucial aspects of the epidemic as it happens, such as the epidemic curve which shows how the number of cases changes over time. We also calculated the basic reproduction number, which is the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus to, and how well we are detecting new cases.   Assessing Entry Point Risks   A significant achievement of our work was creating a global model to assess the risk of the virus being imported into the U.S. through various points of entry like airports. This model helps in making informed decisions on how to control these entry points to reduce the spread.   Innovative Modeling of Virus Transmission   We took a novel approach by developing a data-driven model that considers how peoples behaviors change over time and how this affects the virus's spread. For example, the model takes into account that people moved around less at the beginning of the pandemic and the implications of such changes at different pandemic stages.   Breakthrough in Disease Forecasting   We created a scalable algorithm that can fit semi-parametric models to data, which is a big step forward. This method was tested using data from California and allows us to update our predictions about disease spread quickly as new data comes in.   Utilizing Available Data Effectively   Our findings indicate that using data on when cases are reported is just as accurate for modeling as using data on when people first show symptoms. This is crucial because report times are usually more accessible.   Evaluating Intervention Effectiveness   Lastly, we estimated how effective non-medical actions, like social distancing and lockdowns, were at slowing down the virus in the U.S. These insights are vital for planning future public health strategies.      Broader Impacts   The broader impacts of our research are substantial:   Public Health Strategy: Our findings can guide more effective strategies for managing not only COVID-19 but future pandemics.   Policy Making: The risk assessment at points of entry can inform policy decisions regarding travel restrictions and quarantine requirements.   Community Awareness: Understanding the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions empowers communities to participate in public health measures more willingly.   Global Collaboration: The scalable algorithm and our models can be shared globally, helping other regions to manage their epidemic curves.   Workforce Enhancement: Several students worked on this project, contributing to our technically skilled workforce.   In conclusion, this research enhances our comprehension and management of COVID-19 through innovative modeling and real-time data analysis, providing a foundation for stronger and more informed public health responses.
