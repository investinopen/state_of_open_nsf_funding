<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Microbes can create fuels and chemicals from biomass. Bio-based fuels help contribute to energy security in the US. One current limitation to using microbes for production is that the microbes also use the same biomass to grow. Rapid growth reduces fuel and chemical production.  However, new strategies for controlling the microbial metabolism could separate growth from product formation. The objective of this project is to develop a modular control system to be applied across many different organisms. Success of this project will enhance microbial production of fuels and chemicals, thus advance the bioeconomy.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to evaluate a novel strategy for dynamic metabolic control. We will use advanced computational protein design and engineering to remodel T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP), which transcribes DNA into mRNA, such that it requires a user-defined small molecule to function. This remodeled polymerase would be constitutively expressed. This induction molecule activates the polymerase, resulting in expression of T7-specific genes. We will (i) identify inexpensive chemicals that are non-toxic and non-metabolizable for diverse non-model host organisms; (ii) deploy dynamically controlled circuits in Pseudomonas putida for production of muconate to show improved metrics of titer/yield/productivity; and (iii) demonstrate the utility of T7 RNAP circuits for other biomanufacturing-relevant organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

New tools are urgently needed to control gene expression in response to inexpensive, environmentally innocuous, and safe small molecule chemicals.   We hypothesized that we could control gene expression using an enzyme called T7 RNA polymerase, which transcribes DNA into messenger  RNA. T7 RNA polymerase is used for production of recombinant proteins in  bacteria as well as for production of mRNA used in mRNA vaccines and therapies.   Intellectual Merit:    The research objective of this NSF award was to test a transformative and completely novel strategy for control of gene expression using small molecule chemicals. We used advanced computational protein design and engineering to remodel T7 RNA polymerase so that the enzyme required a small molecule chemical to function. This induction molecule activates the polymerase, resulting in expression of T7-specific genes.

Our work improves our overall ability to engineer life by providing additional means to regulate gene expression in bacteria.   Other goals met with respect to intellectual merit include:   1. We engineered T7 RNA polymerase to be more stable under conditions used for manufacturing of mRNA used in vaccines and therapies. This engineered T7 RNA polymerase enabled a production method called a continuous biomanufacturing process for mRNA. This advance could lead to more scalable and accessible production routes for mRNA used in medicine.   2. We optimized a method for producing mutations in nucleic acid sequences; this population of mutants is called a DNA library. DNA libraries are often used to find optimal enzymes for industrial purposes, and our method could improve on the overall process of screening for such enzymes.   Broader Impacts:   Broader impacts through this award were instantiated through research experience for multiple graduate students, training for multiple graduate students, and educational outreach activities.
