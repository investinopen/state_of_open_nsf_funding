<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Non-technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piezoelectricity was discovered in 1880 by Jacques and Pierre Curie. This property allows materials to convert mechanical stress into electrical signals and vice versa. Piezoelectric devices have important applications in medicine, aerospace, transportation and consumer electronics. For example, piezoelectric elements are used as pressure sensors mobile phones and to monitor combustion in internal combustion engines. For future applications, sensors should operate at nanoscale or microscale level, be flexible and transparent, and easy to integrate with conventional electronics. This project will investigate piezoelectricity in novel two-dimensional (2D) materials, with the aim of realizing next generation devices. 2D materials are atomically thick and have unique optical and electrical properties. Their piezoelectric properties could be used realize mechanically powered transparent flexible charge-generating devices.  This project will enable the fabrication of innovative devices at the microscale and nanoscale with unprecedented applications in medicine, industry, environmental engineering, and consumer electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piezoelectric properties in materials are due to non-centrosymmetric structure of the material crystal structure. It is also known that some materials are non-piezoelectric in their bulk structure. However, when they are thinned in monolayer or several layers, they show piezoelectricity properties. In this work the piezoelectric properties for 2D materials are studied. It presents a novel technique for enhancement of piezoelectric properties in weak piezoelectric two-dimensional materials. Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) are used to enhance the piezoelectric properties of 2D materials. The SAW device will be built on an island of strong Piezoelectric material. The traveling acoustic wave would cause stress and strain on the two-dimensional materials placed on the substrate, which would increase the piezoelectric properties of the two-dimensional materials. The technique of using Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) to activate acoustic waves that couple to the weak piezoelectric material and cause changes in the piezoelectric coefficient of the weak piezoelectric material is novel. In this work we are planning to apply this technique to several two-dimensional materials and measure improved piezoelectric coefficients and their applications, such as in sensors. The proposed method in this research greatly enhances the piezoelectric effect of 2D materials and eliminates the disadvantages of other techniques reported in the literature. The drawbacks in current methods include high demand of fabrication complexity and precision, high cost, and the limitation of the number of stacked layers of 2D materials. Different 2D materials such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and indium selenide (InSe) will be tested and evaluated, including those commonly used and less-studied ones. The outcome of this proposed work will largely extend the utilization range of piezoelectricity of 2D materials, and will turn into more practical and novel devices in electronic, electromechanical, sensors, and optoelectronic fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Award Title:EAGER:      Enhancement of Piezoelectric Properties in two-dimensional materials and      its application Federal Award      ID:2033044 Report Submission      Period:08/01/2022 to 07/31/2023       Research Outcome:      Various 2D materials such as MoS2, MoSe2, WTe2 , and Wse2 have been fabricated to be piezoelectric by using specific structure e.g. Single layer vs multiple layers vs heterostructure or AA-Stacking. Theses current techniques highly depend on the growth method and fabrication quality which is complicated fabrication processes and at high cost. Compared to the reported work, our proposed technique has the following advantages  It greatly reduces the high demands of the fabrication process precision that is used to control the formation of piezoelectric crystal lattice of 2D materials as reported in the literature. Our proposed technique will make the production process easier, faster, and at lower cost. More important it has great potential to strongly enhance the piezoelectricity of 2D materials to be practically useful for building devices, according to the preliminary results we have. According to reported study the number of atomic layers and thickness has impact on the piezoelectricity, which limits the integration and utilization of piezoelectric 2D materials in many applications. This also reduces the capability in modulating energy levels of 2D materials which is a unique property of 2D materials, Using our proposed method which does not depend on stacking different number of layers, this limit will be removed. In this project all the experiment samples and devices were designed, fabricated, and measured using nanofab facilities at GWU Nanofabrication and imaging center (GWNIC) and at NIST center for Nanoscale Science and technology (CNST)        The following tasks for this work were accomplished:       Task 1: Design and fabricate baseline structure.    Task 2: Add ZnO island to enhance the piezoelectric property of 2D materials film.    Task 3: Use Optical microscope, SEM, and X-Ray diffraction to verify the fabrication.    Task 4: Trouble - Shooting and design modification    Task 5: Design, fabricate and test SAW on flexible substrate    Task 6: Fabricate the structure and test SAW effect on 2D piezoelectric coefficient    of the material flakes.
