<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Photosynthesis is the most powerful biological process on earth.  The first step in photosynthesis is the capture of energy in the form of light by biological antenna. Currently, the ability to design and construct functional biological antenna is severely limited. This project will significantly advance the knowledge of how light energy is captured and converted by biological antenna during photosynthesis.  The products of photosynthesis, oxygen and organic matter, are used to make and power virtually all other life forms on earth in addition to providing a significant portion of humanity’s energy needs. Because light is a diffuse energy source, plants and other photosynthetic microorganisms deploy large arrays of light harvesting antenna in their cells to concentrate light into specific locations where chemical reactions occur at high rates. These biological antennae are made from hundreds of light absorbing molecules held together in ways which ensures operation with near perfect efficiency. This proposal will identify the critical structural elements in antennae and explore ways to engineer them in cells. Understanding the design principles of biological light harvesting and developing methods to construct new antennae will open new ways to improve light harvesting systems in crops and increase their productivity. The project will support the career of one female post-doctoral fellow and one graduate student. In addition, a program aimed at introducing children into the basic concepts of Science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM) will be developed with local schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological antennae are mostly membrane bound and contain hundreds of light harvesting pigments. The ability to construct functional antenna variants in cells is limited and this hinders the understanding of antenna in their natural context, as they form super complexes with photochemical reaction centers. This proposal focuses on one of the major antennae systems on the planet called IsiA, which is prevalent in the cyanobacteria phylum. Due to the large diversity of cyanobacteria, a large number of IsiA sequence variants evolved and can be retrieved from public databases. This proposal will explore the functional significance of this variability by introducing chimeric antennae into a model cyanobacterium. In response to stress IsiA is induced and forms very large and symmetrical antennae assemblies in cells. The abilities of chimeric antennae to from these assemblies, to carry out energy transfer and to support cellular growth under stress will be measured. The results will identify the mechanisms by which antennae contribute to cellular resistance to stress and will generate a cellular platform for the construction of novel antennae systems with desired properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The first is enabling the formation of living organisms, via carbon fixation, and the second is providing the energy needed to sustain these organisms, also in the form of reduced carbon and atmospheric oxygen. All the photosynthetic organisms we know of developed large systems of biological antennae, systems capable of collecting, concentrating, and modulating light energy. These biological antennae exist in cells as large arrays of hundreds and thousands of individual molecules that act together to achieve these functions. In this project we studied one such biological antenna that is common in photosynthetic bacteria. This system is relatively understudied due to the challenges it presents on multiple levels. One of these challenges, common to many other biological structures, is the fact that these structures are inherently flexible and carry out their function in flexible phases, such as membranes. Flexibility is a challenge because our current understanding of light harvesting requires that certain elements in the structures of antennae are kept within very tight tolerances, and any deviation from these tolerances can dramatically decrease antennae performance. As part of this project, we first measured just how large the flexibility in biological antennae is, and we found that it far surpassed our expectations. Since we know biological antennae are highly efficient, this finding let us to try and understand what elements in the structures of these antennae maintain their efficiency while being so flexible. We used a combination of theoretical studies and experiments that looked at the behavior of individual antenna to demonstrate that it takes only a small number of molecules in key positions to minimize the effect of flexibility on antennae efficiency. This finding is important because the positions of many molecules involved in light harvesting seem random, here we identified a design principle for the rational positioning of some of these molecules, to minimize the effects of flexibility.</span></p> <p><span>To prove that these positions are indeed important of light harvesting efficiency we designed antennae proteins with different properties and tried to define specific binding modes with specific structural features of the protein. We showed that although the antennae studied in this project consists of multiple repeats of the same protein, it has the capability of binding different surfaces using different binding modes. This sets the stage to understand how such a system is organized and assembled. The long-term goal of this project is to develop the ability to design biological antennae with desired properties. This can lead to both improved light harvesting in bacteria and plants in the form of improved strains and to improve our ability to construct human made antennae systems, which currently vastly underperform biological ones, especially when it comes to their ability to transduce light over long distances (hundreds of molecules). These abilities are important to fully harvest the potential of sunlight as an energy source in many processes.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 11/29/2023<br> Modified by: Yuval&nbsp;Mazor</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2034021/2034021_10676096_1701301177314_Figure_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2034021/2034021_10676096_1701301177314_Figure_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3: The structure of PSI-IsiADC."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2034021/2034021_10676096_1701301177314_Figure_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3: The structure of PSI-IsiADC."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(A) The map obtained from a mutant complex (light yellow) superposed on the full structures.
