<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This workshop will bring together experts working to define new research topics of particular relevance to Native American social scientists. Language is a critical component of human societies, and so it has an important place in the social sciences. For Native Americans, this emphasis on language has led to an upsurge in revitalization programs. Language Learning in Native American Revitalization Programs (LLiNARP) addresses the current low percentage of underrepresented minorities in social science research. The many language revitalization programs developed by Native American communities have opened a new area of research in language acquisition and linguistic theory. These programs are of high relevance to Native Americans, and this workshop will help promote the work of active Native American social scientists and bring new researchers into collaborations and projects that have yet to materialize. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of the workshop are to define new research topics within linguistics that will involve Native American researchers, to explore the ways in which language acquisition in revitalization programs differs from other situations, and to engage federal and private funders in a discussion of how these new topics will fulfill their missions. The broader impacts will include enhanced tools and theories for documenting and reviving languages; revitalization often depends heavily on previous documentation, and its use is more effective when its assumptions and implications are better understood. Revitalization programs have positive health benefits for the communities involved, and better guidelines for creating successful programs should lead to further benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The science of linguistics has found it challenging to accommodate the structures of Native American languages. The many language revitalization programs developed by Native American communities have opened a new area of research in language acquisition.   How language is learned (and modified) in the absence of a large speaking community has not yet been studied by linguists, and thus implications for language learning in such communities remain unknown, as well.   A major obstacle to conducting research on such languages has been that acquisition researchers lack expertise in their structure. These languages are unrelated to English and other commonly studied languages, and they generally have a challenging verbal morphology. The only realistic avenue for exploring this untouched topic is to combine the skills and resources of academic researchers with those of the speakers and learners of the languages.   Revitalization programs have existed for half a century, presenting us with an opportunity to make this language learning process a focus of our scientific attention, and to provide a compelling opportunity for Native Americans to join in behavioral research.   Health effects of language revitalization programs are of special importance to Native communities. The implications of research on Indigenous languages of the United States have implications for linguistic theory in general, and those were explored in a third strand of the workshop.   Language Learning in Native American Revitalization Programs (LLiNARP), brought together 21 researchers and language activists, along with 10 students and recent Ph.D. awardees. Working groups addressed three major topics: the impact of language revitalization programs and the linguistic data they generate on linguistic theory; the influence that revitalization programs, especially those where there are no first-language speakers have on theories of language acquisition; and discussion of the health benefits of language maintenance and revitalization.   A supplement allowed for the dissemination of the health working groups conclusions directly to tribal representatives. Information about the working groups conclusions, including a recommended language realist review, was disseminated to 1,891 contacts, including 315 Tribal newspapers, 242 tribal Facebook sites, and 464 Tribal health contacts. This has greatly increased awareness of the published article, which has now been accessed over 5,000 times. Although it is too soon to see concrete changes due to this awareness, we expect that greater support for Native languages and their health benefits will be obtained in the future.   Expanding the range of evidence used in linguistic argumentation is a continuing goal and one that was advanced further at the workshop. Indigenous languages are particularly challenging for the dominant models in linguistics, and that was highlighted at the workshop.
