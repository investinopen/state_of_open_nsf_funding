<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a standalone, non-invasive pan-cancer diagnostic test to eliminate the annual loss of more than 240,000 patients to late-stage cancer. The detection of multiple cancers early and with a single test may capture part of the $11.5 billion cost burden associated with existing diagnostic standards that result in unnecessary follow-up tests, overtreatment, complications due to late-stage treatment, and hospitalization costs from extended in-patient stays. By enabling physicians to detect cancer early and further subtype disease, the platform will allow for capabilities beyond detection, including treatment matching, therapy monitoring, and biomarker discovery—contributing to the broader health care goal of personalizing medicine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a diagnostic platform that provides a dynamic molecular profile that maps the evolution of cancer in the body.  The technology relies on a novel classification of biomarkers produced by both cancer cells and healthy cells. This technique analyzes the shared derived traits of the proteins and metabolites that cells release into the blood as they mutate and become cancerous, and further classifies these biomarkers in an easily interpretable evolutionary model. The technology fundamentally advances the understanding of the cancer “switch” by both recognizing and making sense of the variety of causal factors that lead to cancer development.  Preliminary data suggests a high level of accuracy (&gt;95% sensitivity and specificity), supported by peer-reviewed publications.  This technology platform may provide a comprehensive portrait of a patient’s disease state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The I-Corps program has provided access to industry, academic, and regulatory experts as well as funding to travel to industry conferences to meet and speak with these individuals. As a team we had some business knowledge starting this course, but the depth of knowledge gained throughout has been invaluable for those with more technical backgrounds.   The first summer (2020) of this award was an intensive, months-long endeavor to meet and interview with at least 100 people in order to validate or invalidate our hypotheses regarding different customer segments. These customer segments were physicians, laboratories, self-insurers, and regulators. In speaking with over 100 people spanning our four customer segments, we were able to dial in our understanding of our own value propositions as they related to the needs of the industry.   We believe it is important to note that this program was taking place as the world was going remote during COVID lockdowns. While the approach to interviewing was adapted to work over the phone and on zoom, we believe that not being able to travel and meet many of these people face to face at some times undermined the quality of the interviews and long-term relationships built with those experts.    After completing the summer intensive portion our team took the value propositions we had narrowed down and looked towards developing a minimum viable product for the market and building out a team of advisors that would bring with them experience in fundraising early-stage biotechnologies. We are pleased to announce that we have achieved both of these goals.   With the remaining funds from the award to be used for registration and travel to industry conferences, we applied for two no-cost extensions of the award, aiming to use of the funds once COVID travel restrictions were lifted and in-person events resumed. This took us to summer of 2023 when we attended two major conferences and continued with the I-Corps approach of validating hypotheses as they pertained to our value propositions. The takeaways from these conferences as describe in previous annual reports and in this final report have helped us recognize another hair-on-fire problem within the industry: the need for an analytical means of interpreting disease heterogeneity.   These key industry insights and a depth of knowledge gained would not have been so accessible to us were it not for the assistance of the I-Corps program.

Our team plans to apply for further non-dilutive funding from the NSF and other government agencies in order to fine tune our approach to meet the current and future needs of market.
