<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) is composed of high-frequency radars that can observe far reaches of the Earth's ionosphere, its features and irregularities, and monitor its dynamics. The ionosphere is an ionized layer in the upper atmosphere (at and above ~110-km altitude) where electrical currents can flow in response to the coupling between the Earth's magnetosphere and solar wind plasma flow in the Earth's neighborhood (geospace). Many geospace phenomena are caused by solar flares and coronal mass ejections that have their effects transmitted to ionospheric layers, which are especially strong in the polar regions. The ionospheric plasma convection (that carries ionospheric currents) becomes strong during geomagnetic storms when it moves as a whole over both polar caps from dayside to nightside and then returns to the dayside via respective auroral zones. Polar ionospheres are also electrically connected via the Earth's magnetic field lines in conjugate points. The ionospheric connection plays a very important role in transporting currents and electric fields between the magnetopause and both polar regions, but these processes are still insufficiently studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large network of SuperDARN radars already observe ionospheric convection in the northern and southern polar regions on a regular basis. Data from these radars are used to study responses of ionospheric convection to solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field changes, the relation of central polar cap convection to that of the cusp and midnight regions, and to the state of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The NSF-funded Antarctic SuperDARN radars at McMurdo and South Pole contribute to the studies such as relationships between wave structures observed in the solar wind and respective responses in the polar caps, motion of plasma density structures, ion-neutral coupling, and thermospheric winds. This research effort will continue developing the NSF-funded radars, help addressing fundamental questions of the Geospace research that have not yet thoroughly examined.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This grant supported the operation of, and research using, the recently completed SuperDARN radars at McMurdo Station (MCM) and Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (SPR). We conducted research into fundamental topics of how solar wind momentum and energy couple into the Earths magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. In addition we modified the radar systems to greatly improve their capabilities.   Both the McMurdo and South Pole radars operated well with only one significant interruption for the entire 5-year period of the grant. South Pole experienced the failure of a critical piece of equipment in June of 2018 thatresulted in no data being collected from then until the annual maintenance visit that year.   An imaging receiver system for the McMurdo Station radar was developed in the first two years of the grant and then installed in the 2017/2018 Austral summer. At each site, the system uses software defined radios, along with additional supporting electronics that were designed by student engineers. In the new system, each antenna is attached to its own receiver/synthesizer rather than to the phasing electronics used in typical phased array antennas. Each antenna produces an independent data stream which can be combined in software rather than using analog electronics, which leads to significantly improved performance in beam forming. In addition, it is possible to save the data streams from the individual antennas, which allows alternative processing techniques that can provide substantially better azimuthal resolution than is provided by beam forming.   Over the period of the grant we have visited both radar sites every year when it has been possible to do so. Starting in 2020, however Covid protocols and other logistical constraints have meant that we have visited McMurdo only once (2022), and have not been able to travel to South Pole at all.   Research supported under the grant included three main topics: 1. Generation of plasma irregularities by instability processes; 2. Ion-neutral coupling and atmospheric heating; and 3. High-resolution observations of convection dynamics. Significant results were obtained in each area, which have been published in the scientific literature.
